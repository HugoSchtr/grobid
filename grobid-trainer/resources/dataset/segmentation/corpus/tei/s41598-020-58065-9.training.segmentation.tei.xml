			<body>from LaH 10 to room-temperature <lb/>superconductors <lb/>M. Kostrzewa 1 , K. M. Szczęśniak 2 , A. p. Durajski 3* &amp; R. Szczęśniak 1,3 <lb/>thermodynamic parameters of the LaH 10 superconductor were an object of our interest. LaH 10 is <lb/>characterised by the highest experimentally observed value of the critical temperature: = <lb/>T <lb/>215 <lb/>C <lb/>a <lb/>K <lb/>(p a = 150 GPa) and <lb/>= <lb/>T <lb/>260 <lb/>C <lb/>b <lb/>K (p b = 190 GPa). It belongs to the group of superconductors with a strong <lb/>electron-phonon coupling (λ a ~ 2.2 and λ b ~ 2.8). We calculated the thermodynamic parameters of this <lb/>superconductor and found that the values of the order parameter, the thermodynamic critical field, and <lb/>the specific heat differ significantly from the values predicted by the conventional BCS theory. Due to <lb/>the specific structure of the Eliashberg function for the hydrogenated compounds, the qualitative <lb/>analysis suggests that the superconductors of the La δ X 1−δ H 10 -type (LaXH-type) structure, where <lb/>X ∈ {Sc, Y}, would exhibit significantly higher critical temperature than T C obtained for LaH 10 . in the case <lb/>of LaScH we came to the following assessments: ∈ <lb/>T <lb/>220 267 <lb/>, <lb/>C <lb/>a <lb/>K and ∈ <lb/>T <lb/>263 294 <lb/>, <lb/>C <lb/>b <lb/>K, while the <lb/>results for LaYH were: ∈ <lb/>T <lb/>218 247 <lb/>, <lb/>C <lb/>a <lb/>K and ∈ <lb/>T <lb/>261 274 <lb/>, <lb/>C <lb/>b <lb/>K. <lb/>The experimental discovery of the high-temperature superconducting state in the compressed hydrogen and sul-<lb/>fur systems H 2 S (T C = 150 K for p = 150 GPa) and H 3 S (T C = 203 K for p = 150 GPa) 1,2 accounts for carrying out <lb/>investigations, which can potentially lead to the discovery of a material showing the superconducting properties <lb/>at room temperature. For the first time, the possibility of the existence of the superconducting state in hydrogen-<lb/>ated compounds was pointed out by Ashcroft in 2004 3 . It was stated in his second fundamental work concerning <lb/>the high-temperature superconductivity, following his first work written in 1968, in which he propounded the <lb/>existence of the high-temperature superconducting state in metallic hydrogen 4 . The superconducting state in <lb/>hydrogenated compounds is induced by the conventional electron-phonon interaction. This fact made possible <lb/>the theoretical description of the superconducting phase in H 2 S and H 3 S even prior to carrying out the suitable <lb/>experiments 5,6 . The detailed discussion with respect to the thermodynamic properties of the superconducting <lb/>state occurring in H 2 S and H 3 S one can find in references 7-17 . <lb/>In 2018, there were held the groundbreaking experiments, which confirmed the existence of the supercon-<lb/>ducting state of extremely high values of the critical temperature in the LaH 10 compound: <lb/>= <lb/>T <lb/>215 <lb/>C <lb/>a <lb/>K for <lb/>p a = 150 GPa and <lb/>= <lb/>T <lb/>260 <lb/>C <lb/>b <lb/>K for p b ∈ (180-200) GPa (and then T <lb/>250 <lb/>C <lb/>c <lb/>K for p c ~ 170 GPa 18 ). It was proved <lb/>on the theoretical basis 19 that the results achieved by Drozdov et al. 20 can be related to the induction of the <lb/>superconducting phase in the R m <lb/>3 structure (T C = 206-223 K). The experimental results reported by <lb/>Somayazulu et al. 21 should be related to the superconducting state induced in the Fm m <lb/>3 structure, where the <lb/>critical temperature can potentially reach even the value of 280 K. From the materials science perspective, the <lb/>achieved results imply that all possible actions should be taken in order to examine the hydrogen-containing <lb/>materials with respect to the existence of the high-temperature superconducting state at room temperature. <lb/>Attention should be paid to the importance of the discovery of the high-temperature superconducting state in <lb/>LaH 10 because La can form stable hydrogenated compounds with other metals. Such materials can exhibit so <lb/>large hydrogen concentration, that they are presently taken into account as basic components of the hydrogen <lb/>cells intended for vehicle drives 22 . <lb/>The purpose of this work is, firstly, to present the performed analysis of the thermodynamic properties of <lb/>the superconducting state in the LaH 10 compound. We took advantage of the phenomenological version of the <lb/>Eliashberg equations, for which we fitted the value of the electron-phonon coupling constant on the basis of <lb/>the experimentally found T C value. Our next step consisted in examining the hydrogenated compounds of the <lb/>La δ X 1−δ H 10 -type (LaXH-type) on the basis of the achieved results in order to find a system with an even higher <lb/>value of the critical temperature. Taking into account the structure of the Eliashberg function for hydrogenated <lb/></body>

			<body>computational Details, Results and Discussion <lb/>The thermodynamic parameters of the LaH 10 superconductor were calculated by means of Eliashberg equations <lb/>on the imaginary axis 23 : <lb/>∑ <lb/>π <lb/>μ <lb/>Δ <lb/>= <lb/>Ω − Ω − <lb/>Ω <lb/>Ω + Δ <lb/>Δ <lb/>=− <lb/>Z <lb/>k T <lb/>K <lb/>[ ( <lb/>) <lb/>( )] <lb/>, <lb/>(1) <lb/></body>

			<body>The symbols Δ = Δ Ω <lb/>i <lb/>( ) <lb/>n <lb/>n and = <lb/>Ω <lb/>Z <lb/>Z i <lb/>( ) <lb/>n <lb/>n denote the order parameter and the wave function renormalization <lb/>factor, respectively. The quantity Ω n represents the Matsubara frequency: <lb/>π <lb/>Ω = <lb/>− <lb/>k T n <lb/>(2 <lb/>1) <lb/>n <lb/>B <lb/>, where k B is the <lb/>Boltzmann constant. The pairing kernel is defined by: <lb/>λ <lb/>Ω − Ω = <lb/>Ω <lb/>Ω − Ω <lb/>+Ω <lb/>K( <lb/>) <lb/>n <lb/>m <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>C <lb/>n <lb/>m <lb/>C <lb/>2 <lb/>2 <lb/>2 , where λ denotes the elec-<lb/>tron-phonon coupling constant. We determined the value of λ on the basis of experimental data 20,21 and the <lb/>condition: Δ <lb/>= <lb/>= = <lb/>[ <lb/>] <lb/>0 <lb/>n <lb/>T T <lb/>1 <lb/>C <lb/>. The fitting between the theory and the experimental results is presented in Fig. 1. We <lb/>obtained λ a = 2.187 for p a = 150 GPa and λ b = 2.818 for p b = 190 GPa. The symbol Ω C represents the character-<lb/>istic phonon frequency, its value being assumed as Ω C = 100 meV. <lb/>The repulsion between electrons is modeled by the function: μ <lb/>μ θ <lb/>Ω = <lb/>Ω − Ω <lb/>( ) <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>m <lb/>C <lb/>m <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>, where  <lb/>μ is the <lb/>Coulomb pseudopotential (  <lb/>μ = 0.1). The quantity Ω C denotes the cut-off frequency (Ω C = 1 eV). The Eliashberg <lb/>equations were solved for the Matsubara frequency equal to 1000. We used numerical methods presented in the <lb/>previous paper 24 . In the considered case, we obtained stable equation solutions for T ≥ T 0 = 15 K. <lb/>Figure 2 illustrates the full dependence of the order parameter on temperature. Physical values of the order <lb/>parameter were calculated from the equation: Δ <lb/>= <lb/>Δ Ω = Δ <lb/>T <lb/>T <lb/>( ) Re[ ( <lb/>( ))], while the function of the order <lb/>parameter on the real axis (Δ Ω <lb/>( )) was determined using the solutions of the Eliashberg equations on the imagi-<lb/>nary axis and the analytical continuation method described in the reference 25 . It can be easily seen that the order <lb/>parameter curves determined within the Eliashberg formalism differ significantly from the curves resulting from <lb/>the BCS theory 26,27 . These differences arise from the very high value of the electron-phonon coupling constant of <lb/>the superconductor, what is mirrored by the high value of the dimensionless <lb/>= Δ <lb/>Δ <lb/>R <lb/>T k T <lb/>2 ( )/ B C <lb/>0 <lb/>ratio, namely <lb/>= . <lb/>Δ <lb/>R <lb/>4 91 <lb/>a <lb/>and <lb/>= . <lb/>Δ <lb/>R <lb/>5 25 <lb/>b <lb/>. Let us recall that within the BCS theory we come to the result: <lb/>= . <lb/>Δ <lb/>R <lb/>[ ] <lb/>353 <lb/>BCS <lb/>, how-<lb/>ever the BCS theory approximates well the experimental results for λ &lt; 0.5. <lb/>We plotted the temperature dependence of the effective electron mass (m e <lb/> ) to the band electron mass (m e ) <lb/>ratio in the insets in Fig. 2. The value of the  <lb/>m m <lb/>/ <lb/>e <lb/>e ratio is given with good approximation by the value of 1 + λ 28 . <lb/>Figure 3 presents the results achieved for the difference in free energy between the superconducting and the <lb/>normal state (ΔF), the thermodynamic critical field (H C ), and the specific heat in both the superconducting (C S ) <lb/>and the normal (C N ) states. The values of the considered quantities were calculated on the basis of formulae given <lb/>in reference 28 . In particular, the difference in free energy between the superconducting and the normal state is <lb/>given by: <lb/>Figure 1. The dependence of the maximum value of the order parameter on the electron-phonon coupling <lb/>constant. We consider two cases: = <lb/>T <lb/>215 <lb/>C <lb/>a <lb/>K (p a = 150 GPa) and = <lb/>T <lb/>260 <lb/>C <lb/>b <lb/>K (p b = 190 GPa). <lb/></body>

		<body>The Sommerfeld constant take the form: γ <lb/>π <lb/>λ <lb/>= <lb/>+ <lb/>(1 <lb/>) <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>2 <lb/>. <lb/>Deviations from the results of the theory can be traced in the easiest way by determining the values of <lb/>ratios: <lb/>R <lb/>T C T H <lb/>( )/ (0) <lb/>H <lb/>C <lb/>N <lb/>C <lb/>C <lb/>2 <lb/>R <lb/>C T C T <lb/>( )/ ( ) <lb/>C <lb/>C <lb/>N <lb/>C . For the LaH superconductor, we <lb/>the following results: <lb/>. <lb/>R <lb/>0 117 <lb/>H <lb/>a <lb/>= . <lb/>R <lb/>0 113 <lb/>H <lb/>b <lb/>= . <lb/>R <lb/>3 51 <lb/>C <lb/>a <lb/>= . <lb/>R <lb/>3 75 <lb/>C <lb/>b <lb/>It is worth noticing that the <lb/>BCS theory predicts <lb/>. <lb/>R <lb/>[ ] <lb/>0168 <lb/>H BCS <lb/>= . <lb/>R <lb/>[ ] <lb/>143 <lb/>C BCS <lb/>. <lb/>The subsequent last part of the paper discusses the question of induction of the superconducting state in a <lb/>of compounds of the La 1−δ H 10 -type (or LaXH-type for short). Firstly, we are going to give some criteria, <lb/>which can potentially make easier the search for a material showing the required high-temperature supercon-<lb/>ducting properties. To do this, let us take into account the formula for the critical temperature valid for the BCS <lb/>ρ <lb/>= . Ω <lb/>− <lb/>k T <lb/>V <lb/>1 13 <lb/>exp[ 1/ (0) ] <lb/>B C <lb/>max <lb/>where Ω max the Debye frequency and stands for the pairing <lb/>potential value. It can be easily noticed that the critical temperature is the higher, the greater are the values of the <lb/>density of states at the Fermi surface, the pairing potential, and the maximum phonon frequency. <lb/>Therefore it should be supposed, even at such an early stage of analysis, that special attention is to be paid to these <lb/>compounds, for which the respective non-hydrogenated compounds (La 1−δ ) or hydrides XH <lb/>exhibit the high density of electron states at the Fermi surface. Considerations given to the pairing potential at the <lb/>level do not get us very far because this quantity is calculated in a rather complicated way, <lb/>employing the DFT (Density Functional Theory) method. <lb/>Nevertheless, a sensible qualitative analysis can be made with respect to the influence of the atomic mass of the <lb/>element on a value of the critical temperature (since the mass of the X element determines ). In this regard, <lb/>let us refer to the theoretical results obtained within the Eliashberg formalism for H and H 3 S superconduc-<lb/>tors 5,6 . They prove that contributions to the Eliashberg function (α <lb/>F( ) <lb/>2 <lb/>coming from sulphur and from hydro-<lb/>gen are separated due to a huge difference between atomic masses of these two elements. To be precise, the <lb/>electron-phonon interaction derived from sulphur is crucial in the frequency range from 0 meV to max <lb/>S <lb/>equal to <lb/>about 70 meV, while the contribution derived from hydrogen (Ω <lb/>220 <lb/>max <lb/>H <lb/>is significant above ~100 meV. <lb/>It is noteworthy that we come upon a similar situation in the case of the LaH compound . Therefore the follow-<lb/>ing factorization of the Eliashberg function for the LaXH compound can be assumed: <lb/>λ <lb/>θ <lb/>λ <lb/>θ <lb/>λ <lb/>θ <lb/>Ω = <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>    <lb/>Ω <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>    <lb/>Ω <lb/>− Ω + <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>    <lb/>Ω <lb/>Ω <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>     <lb/>Ω <lb/>− Ω <lb/>+ <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>    <lb/>Ω <lb/>Ω <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>     <lb/>Ω <lb/>− Ω <lb/>F( ) <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>) , <lb/>(7) <lb/>L a <lb/>max <lb/>La 2 <lb/>La <lb/>X <lb/>max <lb/>X <lb/>2 <lb/>X <lb/>H <lb/>max <lb/>H <lb/>2 <lb/>max <lb/>H <lb/>where λ La λ X , and λ H are the contributions to the electron-phonon coupling constant derived from both metals <lb/>(La, X) and hydrogen, respectively. Similarly, the symbols Ω max <lb/>La Ω max <lb/>X , and Ω max <lb/>H the respective maxi-<lb/>mum phonon frequencies. The value of the critical temperature can be assessed from the generalised formula of <lb/>BCS theory 7 : <lb/>λ <lb/>λ <lb/>λμ <lb/>= <lb/>Ω <lb/>. <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>− . <lb/>+ <lb/>− + . <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>k T <lb/>f f <lb/>1 27 <lb/>exp <lb/>1 14(1 <lb/>) <lb/>(1 0 163 ) <lb/>, <lb/>(8) <lb/>C <lb/>1 2 <lb/>ln <lb/> <lb/>the symbols appearing in Eq.

The quantity <lb/>μ occurring in the Eq. (8) serves now as the <lb/>fitting parameter. One should remember that the formula for the critical temperature given by the Eq. (8) was <lb/>derived with the use of significant simplifying assumptions (the value of the cut-off frequency is neglected, as well <lb/>as the retardation effects modeled by the Matsubara frequency). Therefore the value of the Coulomb pseudopo-<lb/>tential determined from the full Eliashberg equations usually differs the value of  <lb/>μ analytically. <lb/>The experimental data for the LaH can be reproduced using Eq. (8) and assuming that <lb/>μ = . <lb/>0 170 <lb/>a <lb/>μ = . <lb/>0 276 <lb/>b <lb/> <lb/>. <lb/>The achieved results are in 4. It is evident that into consideration additional X ele-<lb/>ment, which enriches the LaH composition, leads to a large increase in the critical temperature value. The esti-<lb/>mated upper limit of the C <lb/>a is equal to 288 K for a = 150 GPa, while for b = GPa we obtain <lb/>T <lb/>315 <lb/>C <lb/>b <lb/>Therefore the superconducting state can at room temperature for both cases. <lb/>Now, let us take into account elements with the identical electron configuration at the valence shell as lantha-<lb/>num, but lighter than lanthanum: scandium and yttrium, both being selected as X. Attention should be paid to the <lb/>fact that the electron configuration of X, identical as in lanthanum, should minimize such changes in properties <lb/>of the obtained compound which could from changes in both the electron dispersion relation and <lb/>matrix elements the electron-phonon interaction.

For LaScH we got: <lb/>T <lb/>220, 267 <lb/>C <lb/>a <lb/>and <lb/>∈ <lb/>T <lb/>C <lb/>b <lb/>K, while the results for LaYH are as follows: <lb/>∈ <lb/>T <lb/>218, 247 <lb/>C <lb/>a <lb/>K and <lb/>∈ <lb/>T <lb/>261, 274 <lb/>C <lb/>b <lb/>K. Apparently, the significant increase in the critical temperature value should be observed in <lb/>both cases. The effect of growth in the value of the critical temperature results from filling the gap in the Eliashberg <lb/>between the contributions coming from La and H, as was already stated above. <lb/>summarize, the experimental results obtained for the LaH compound get us much closer to the pur-<lb/>pose of obtaining the superconducting state at room temperature. The huge difference between atomic masses <lb/>of lanthanum and hydrogen results in the characteristic structure of the Eliashberg function modeling the <lb/>electron-phonon interaction in the considered compound, with distinctly separated parts proceeded either from <lb/>or from hydrogen. The proper selection of the additional element (X) in the LaXH compound is <lb/>expected to fill the &apos; empty&apos; range of the Eliashberg function between the parts coming from La and H. In our opin-<lb/>ion, good candidates are scandium and yttrium. These elements have the electron configuration at the valence <lb/>shell exactly the same as lanthanum, and yet they are considerably lighter. Our numerical calculations suggest the <lb/>Figure 4.

			<body>possible growth in the temperature of LaScH compound equal to about 52 K GPa) or to about <lb/>79 K (190 GPa) compared to the T C value for the LaH 10 As far as the LaYH compound is con-<lb/>the pertinent increase in T C can reach about K for 150 GPa or about 59 K for 190 GPa. <lb/>results can be the starting point for the advanced DFT calculations or perhaps provide inspiration for <lb/>out the appropriate experimental measurements. Of course, we realize that the presented analysis is <lb/>on the semi-quantitative approximations and may raise some critical remarks. For this reason, we refer to <lb/>the most significant reservations: <lb/>In the paper, we assume the relatively simple form of Eliashberg function, which is the linear combination of each <lb/>the contributions from La, H and X. Does this mean that any contribution related to Sc or Y will be positive? <lb/>course, this doesn&apos;t have to be the case. For example, the properly selected concentration of Sc or Y atoms <lb/>can lead to a decrease in the electron-phonon coupling constant. On the other hand, one should remember <lb/>results obtained for YH compound 32,33 . Based on the DFT method, it was found that the critical temper-<lb/>ature for ∈ <lb/>p (250, 300) GPa can exceed the room temperature ( <lb/>[ ] <lb/>320 <lb/>C max <lb/>This result suggests that a <lb/>high concentration of Y atoms in the LaYH compound should not lead to a decrease in . It should also be <lb/>noted that future DFT calculations (or possible experiments) should take into account different concentra-<lb/>of Sc and Y atoms. <lb/>In the paper, we assume that the phonon frequency regime is completely decoupled (La contributes to low pho-<lb/>non modes and hydrogen vibration should be high). What significance will La-H, Sc-H or Y-H modes which are <lb/>to the moderate frequency regime? In our opinion, they will contribute to the increase in the critical <lb/>temperature. This will result from activating the Eliashberg function in the frequency range from ~ 40 meV <lb/>to ~100 meV. This effect was clearly visible in the case of YSH and LaSH 6 (p ~ 200 GPa), where the role of <lb/>dopant fulfilled sulphur . <lb/>• Do the values of the Coulomb pseudopotential assumed in (8) (  <lb/>μ = . <lb/>0 170 <lb/>a <lb/>and μ = . <lb/>0 276 <lb/>b <lb/> <lb/>roughly corre-<lb/>spond to the physical values of this parameters? In particular, are these values too low, which would lead to the <lb/>overestimation of the critical temperature in our paper. In this case, it is worth referring to the <lb/>obtained DFT results for LaH . In the publication , the authors showed that qualitative compliance <lb/>experimental assuming  <lb/>μ 0.2 ( <lb/>= <lb/>T <lb/>[ ] <lb/>197 <lb/>C p 150GPa <lb/>K for the crystal structure <lb/>m, and <lb/>= <lb/>[ ] <lb/>271 <lb/>C p 200GPa <lb/>K for the crystal structure Fm3m). In the first case, the experimental critical tem-<lb/>perature was underestimated by 18 K (too high value of  <lb/>μ in the second case, <lb/>[ ] <lb/>C exp was revalued by 11 K <lb/>(too low value of  <lb/>μ the results obtained in the paper ours, it is clearly seen that a <lb/> b <lb/> <lb/>are fairly well-obtained. In the most interesting case for LaH 10 corresponds to the pressure of 190 GPa, taking <lb/>account the possible reduction of b <lb/> suggested in , the increase in the critical temperature value for the <lb/>LaScH and LaYH compounds can be expected. It is worth noting that our results also correlate well with the <lb/>obtained in the paper , where  <lb/>μ 0.22 was assumed, which allowed to reproduce the experimental <lb/>temperature for LaH (p = 190 GPa). <lb/>One needs to recognise that the exact quantitative analysis of the problem discussed in our work would <lb/>require to be carried out using the Eliashberg equations including the anharmonicity of the phonon system and <lb/>the non-linear terms of the electron-phonon-phonon interaction, especially for such high values of the critical <lb/>as are observed for LaH . Presently we work upon the derivation of suitable equations. <lb/></body>
