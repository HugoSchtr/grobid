AUCTION TERMS 

This is a public, mail bid, and internet auction conducted by Classical 
Numismatic Group, Inc. (CNG). Bidding in the auction constitutes 
acceptance of the following terms: 

1. 
The property listed in this catalogue is offered for sale by 
CNG for itself and as agent for various owners and other consignors. 
We reserve the right to reject any bid, to determine the opening price, 
to set bidding increments, to vary the order of the auction, to reopen 
bidding in the case of a dispute, to withdraw any lot, to bid on behalf 
of CNG, to bid on behalf of the consignor, to permit the auctioneer to 
bid on his own behalf, and to permit the consignor to bid on his own 
lots. CNG may loan or advance money to consignors or prospective 
bidders, and may have an interest other than commission charges in 
any lot. CNG may bid on its own account as an &quot;insider&quot; with infor-
mation not available to the public. 

2. 
A buyer&apos;s fee will be charged to all successful bidders as fol-
lows on the hammer price: 
A. 21% for written, fax, email, telephone, and live internet bids. 
B. 19% for floor bids placed in person at the auction and electronic 
bids placed directly on www.cngcoins.com. 
All written bids, email bids, non-live telephone bids, live internet bid 
registrations, and live telephone bid registrations must be received 
before 5PM Eastern time on the day before the auction begins. CNG 
reserves the right to change the format of www.cngcoins.com at any 
time. 

3. 
All coins are guaranteed genuine. Attribution, date, condi-
tion, and other descriptions are the opinion of the cataloguer, and no 
warranty is expressed or implied. Please note that an auction sale 
is not an approval sale. Lots examined prior to the sale and lots 
purchased by floor bidders (including bidders executing commission 
bids on behalf of other parties) may not be returned for any reason 
except lack of authenticity. All claims of misdescription and all 
claims of return, except claims regarding authenticity, must be made 
within 5 days of receipt of material. Any claim of lack of authenticity 
must be made in writing by the original purchaser immediately after 
discovery that an item is not authentic, and upon making such a claim 
the original purchaser must immediately return the lot to CNG in the 
same condition as at the time of the auction. Coins that have been 
encapsulated (&quot;slabbed&quot;) by a grading and/or authentication service 
may not be returned for any reason, including authenticity, if they 
have been removed from the encapsulation (&quot;slab&quot;). If payment is 
made by credit card, rights of return are governed by these Auction 
Terms which supercede any rights of return promulgated by the card 
issuer. Estimates are intended as a guide only and not as a statement 
of opinion of value. 

4. 
Invoices are due and payable immediately upon receipt. 
Interest and late fees of 2.0% per month, or at the highest rate permit-
ted by law, whichever is less, from the date of the auction, shall be 
payable on invoices not settled within 30 days of the auction date. 
Payment may be made by check or bank wire. Credit cards (Visa 
or MasterCard) will be accepted; credit card payments will not be 
accepted more than 14 days after the sale date. Payment by check 
must be made in either US dollars ($) drawn on a US bank or British 
sterling (£) drawn on a British bank. All successful bidders outside 
North America and the United Kingdom will be charged an additional 
$20 fee for bank charges that are the result of international wire trans-
fer fees; this fee will be deducted for credit card or check payment as 
described above. CNG may reduce or compromise any charge or fee 
at its discretion. 

5. 
Bidders not known to us must provide us with satisfactory 
credit references or pay a deposit as determined at CNG&apos;s discretion 
before bidding. Minors are not permitted to bid without written con-
sent of a parent guaranteeing payment. CNG may require payment 
in full from any bidder prior to delivery of lots. Title does not pass 
until lots are paid in full. Upon receipt of lots, the buyer assumes full 
responsibility for loss or damage. Delivery to the buyer&apos;s address of 
record shall constitute receipt by the buyer regardless of the identity 
of the person accepting delivery. 

6. 
Estimates are in U.S. dollars ($US) and bids must be in 
even dollar ($) amounts. CNG will execute mail bids on behalf of 
mail bidders. Subject to reserves and opening prices, mail bids will be 
executed at one bidding increment (approximately 10%) over the next 
highest bid. In the case of identical bids, the earliest bid wins. A mail 
bid has priority over an identical floor bid. Bid by lot number. No lots 
will be broken. Bidders are responsible for errors in bidding. Check 
your bid sheet carefully. 

7. 
All lots are subject to reserve unless otherwise indicated. 
However, no reserve will be higher than the estimate, and ordinarily 
lots are reserved at 60% of estimate. 

8. 
Bidders personally guarantee payment for their successful 
bids, including bidders executing commission bids from other parties 
and bidders representing corporations or other entities. Buyers accept-
ing commission bids from other parties do so at their own risk and 
remain responsible for payment under these Auction Terms. 

9. 
At the conclusion of bidding for each lot, the sale contract is 
concluded and the successful bidder becomes liable for immediate 
payment under these Auction Terms. In the event a successful bidder 
fails to make full payment within 30 days of the auction date, CNG 
reserves the right either: (a) to require payment as provided under 
these Auction Terms; or (b) to deem the sale incomplete and to re-auc-
tion the material, in which case the successful bidder agrees to pay for 
the reasonable cost of such a sale and also to pay any shortfall between 
the re-auction price and the successful bidder&apos;s purchase price. CNG 
reserves all rights that it is entitled to under the Pennsylvania Uniform 
Commercial Code, including the right to offset any sums due from a 
successful bidder against any future consignment or purchase or mon-
ies or goods in possession of CNG. 

10. 
Sales tax, postage, handling and insurance are the responsibil-
ity of the buyer and are added to all invoices where appropriate. For 
buyers in the European Union, CNG may import lots into the United 
Kingdom prior to shipment and charge buyers the import Value Added 
Tax. On any tax not paid by the purchaser which should have been 
paid, even if not invoiced by CNG, the purchaser agrees to pay the 
same on demand together with any interest or penalty that may be 
assessed. It is the responsibility of the buyer to comply with foreign 
customs and other regulations. 

11. 
Prices realized are published after the sale and are mailed with 
CNG&apos;s next publication. Prices realized are also posted after the sale 
on CNG&apos;s web site: www.cngcoins.com 

12. 
Bidders hereby waive any claim for incidental, consequential 
or exemplary damages arising from this auction. The sole remedy that 
any participant in the auction shall have for any claim or controversy 
arising out of the auction shall be a refund, without interest, of all or 
part of the purchase price paid by the participant. 

13. 
All rights granted by CNG or otherwise available to bidders 
and purchasers, under these Auction Terms or otherwise, are personal 
and may not be assigned or transferred to any other person or entity, 
whether by operation of law or otherwise. No third party may rely on 
any benefit or right conferred by these Auction Terms. Bidders acting 
as agents must disclose the agency in writing to CNG prior to the auc-
tion; otherwise rights are limited to the agent and are not transferable 
to the undisclosed principal. 

14. 
Any dispute regarding this auction shall be governed by the 
laws of Pennsylvania and shall be adjudicated only by the Lancaster 
County Court of Common Pleas or the U.S. District Court for the 
Eastern District of Pennsylvania; all bidders submit themselves to 
the personal jurisdiction of these courts for this purpose, consent 
to service of process by registered or certified mail, and waive any 
contrary provisions of Articles 14 or 15 of the French Civil Code and 
any similar provisions in any jurisdiction. All bidders consent to the 
confidentiality of consignors&apos; identities and waive any right to require 
disclosure of the name of the consignor or owner of any auction lot, 
whether such right is based on New York GOL  §5-701(a) or any other 
provision in any jurisdiction. In any dispute regarding this auction, the 
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and 
attorney fees.

The reverse die of this series is thought to have been inscribed with the ethnic POPLV, in Etruscan, but none of the extant examples are clear 
enough to be certain. In any event, the die was apparently used long after the legend was worn off, such that most examples, as this, only 
display vague traces of it.

threatened by the warlike Lucanians. His true purpose, however, was to extend his dominion in the west just as his namesake, the king of 
Macedon, was establishing a great empire in the east. After initial successes, his career was abruptly terminated in 330 BC beneath the walls 
of Pandosia, where he perished in battle against the Bruttians, much to the relief of the Tarentine Republic

The goddess on this beautiful stater has variously been identified as Hera, Amphitrite (consort of Poseidon), or Persephone (in her guise as 
consort of Hades and queen of the underworld). While Rutter (in HN Italy) prefers Hera, the iconography of the goddess is consistent with 
Persephone (her diaphanous veil and stephane), and the cult of the chthonian Persephone was one of the most important at Taras.

The obverse type of this coin has traditionally been described as the nymph Satyra, mother of Taras, though the evidence is lacking for positive 
identification. This rendition of Satyra is stylistically similar to that of another local water nymph, Peirene, as she appears on Corinthian 
drachms. The cascading hair style is the obvious attribute for a water nymph interpretation. The reverse bears the standard Tarentine silver

Apollo was worshipped as the patron of colonists at Tarentum, and he was also the patron of the revered Pythagorean religious order at 
Tarentum, which existed until the late fourth century. The reverse motif of Herakles fighting the Nemean lion was also used on contemporary 
silver diobols of Tarentum and its colony Herakleia, though the silver issues usually chose the &quot;tondo&quot; scene of a crouched Herakles wrestling 
the Nemean lion with a stranglehold (a design also used on the Syracusan gold 100 litrae issue of Dionysios I).

Pyrrhos in Italy 

The following five gold issues were struck during the time of Pyrrhos of Epiros&apos;s campaigns in Italy. In the early 3rd Century BC, the 
Tarentines were at war with the Romans. To defeat their superior enemies, they decided that they needed the help of a powerful ally (Pausanias 
1.12.1). So they sought the help of Pyrrhos, who crossed the Adriatic Sea in 280 BC. According to Pausanias, his reasons for joining the war 
were threefold. For one, the Tarentines had assisted him in his war with Korkyra, sending their fleet to augment Pyrrhos&apos; forces. Secondly, 
Pyrrhos was enticed by the assertion of the Tarentine envoys that the land of Italy was prosperous and bountiful. The final, and perhaps most 
important, reason was that Pyrrhos &quot;remembered the capture of Troy, which he took to be an omen of his success in the war, as he was a 
descendant of Achilles making war upon a colony of Trojans&quot; (Pausanias 1.12.1). 

Plutarch relates a wonderful anecdote that as Pyrrhos was deciding whether or not to help the Tarentines, he was counseled by his advisor 
Kineas (Plutarch, Pyrrhus, 14.2-7). Kineas asked his ruler what they should do if they succeed in conquering the Romans, and Pyrrhos replied 
that they would then conquer all of Italy. When asked by Kineas, &quot;What then?&quot;, Pyrrhos replied that he would then move on to capture Sicily. 
The conversation proceeded in this way, until Pyrrhos said that they would eventually conquer the entire world. Kineas then asked what they 
should do once all of their foes were vanquished, to which Pyrrhos said, &quot;We shall be much at ease, and we&apos;ll drink bumpers, my good man, 
every day, and we&apos;ll gladden one another&apos;s hearts with confidential talks&quot; (14.6). Finally Kineas&apos;s point became clear when he said, &quot;Then 
what stands in our way now if we want to drink bumpers and while away the time with one another? Surely this privilege is ours already, and 
we have at hand, without taking any trouble, those things to which we hope to attain by bloodshed and great toils and perils, after doing much 
harm to others and suffering much ourselves&quot; (14.7). Though this logic made him uneasy, Pyrrhos continued with his expedition to Italy. 

Though Pyrrhos was successful in his battles against Rome, the losses he sustained diminished his forces to the extent that he could not 
capitalize on his victories, so he was eventually forced to retreat back to Greece. This situation of tactical victory at a crippling cost is to what 
the expression &quot;Pyrrhic victory&quot; refers. Appropriately, after his victory over Rome at the battle of Asculum in 279 BC, Pyrrhos remarked, &quot;If 
we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined&quot; (Plutarch, Pyrrhus, 21.9).

As with many of the cities of Magna Graecia, the gold issues of Metapontion are typically associated with periods of abnormal military 
expenditure. The similarity of the head of Hera here to that on the issues of Tarentum during the time of Alexander the Molossian, and the 
exceptional appearance of Hera on an issue of Metapontion, suggest that this issue was struck when the city was allied with the Epirote king.

The lovely facing female head on this rare issue was traditionally described as either Demeter or Persephone, the typical female deities on 
Metapontion&apos;s coinage, until a hoard discovered in the 1960s revealed this variety with the declarative inscription NIKA. This unusual feature, 
as well as the overall treatment and choice of the design, has led to the suggestion that it may be part of a special donative issue for Kleonymos 
of Sparta, who exacted a heavy indemnity from the people of Metapontion for foregoing the opportunity to sack the city (see Johnston, p. 3).

Demonstrating the usual flare shown by the die engravers in the service of Pyrrhos during his military expedition in Italy and Sicily, the small 
gold issues of 280/279 depicting Nike and Leukippos (HN Italy 1629-1631) are of a refinement second to none. The traditional city founder 
is rendered in exquisite detail with the added novelty of his helmet being decorated with Skylla hurling a stone, the very embodiment of 
aggressive violence before the enemy in time of war. 

The overstrike on this particular coin is interesting in that the undertype is likely not a coin of Metapontion, due to the orientation of the letter 
if it were an Â in relation to the edge of the coin. Johnston does not note any overstrikes for any of the gold of Metapontion.

(see M.H. Crawford, &quot;Provenances, Attributions, and Chronology of Some Early Italian Coinages,&quot; CH IX (2002), p. 274, and HN Italy). 
While it is likely that this issue was minted in Bruttium by the Carthaginians, there is a possibility that these coins were struck in Carthage and 
transported to South Italy for Hannibal&apos;s use (see G.K. Jenkins, Studi per Laura Breglia, Parte I, Generalia-Numismatica Greca. Bollettino

Punic Coinage at Entella 

In the final decade of the fifth century BC, the Carthaginians launched a series of invasions of Sicily, conquering much of the western half of 
the island and bringing devastation to many formerly flourishing Greek communities. The Punic presence lasted for a century and a half, until 
Rome&apos;s victory in the First Punic War obliged the Carthaginians to withdraw. During their time of occupation, the Carthaginians struck an 
extensive coinage in Sicily for the purpose of financing their military operations and the maintenance of garrisons. The obverse and reverse 
types of the series are mostly influenced by Sicilian prototypes, particularly those of Syracuse, except for the later series with the head of 
Herakles on the obverse, which was obviously influenced by the well-recognized coinage of Alexander the Great. While a few of the series 
are struck at cities with established mints, such as Motya and Panormos, these are often viewed as minor or campaign mints that operated for a 
short duration. The location of the primary Punic mint (or mints) on Sicily, responsible for the large issues studied by G.K. Jenkins (&apos;Carthage&apos; 
series I-V), has been the subject of great debate. Most recently, I. Lee surveyed the existing literature and took a fresh look at the full spectrum 
of evidence, persuasively concluding that this mint was located at Entella (&quot;Entella: The Silver Coinage of the Campanian Mercenaries and 
the First Carthaginian Mint 410-409 BC&quot; in NC 160 [2000], pp. 1-66).

This beautiful piece is from the first coinage struck at Katane following the liberation of the city from Syracusan domination in the late 460s 
BC. The obverse of this series features the local river god Amenanos in the guise of a man-headed bull. On the reverse, the spirited figure of 
Nike holding a diadem appears, like so many Sicilian coin types, to have an agonistic significance, as well as an allusion to the recent victory 
of the native Katanaians and the recovery of their city. Nearly all published examples of this issue have double-struck reverses.

There is little doubt that the engravers of the fourth century Punic tetradrachms were imitating the famous Syracusan masters Euainetos and 
Kimon. The engraver of the dies used for the present coin was certainly a master himself; his work is nearly identical to the style found on the 
dekadrachms of Euainetos, particularly the issues that have the shell behind the neck of Arethousa. While many of the Punic issues are quite 
stylized, the naturalistic representation presented here is clearly the work of a superior artist.

The Syracusan ruler Hieron II, a loyal ally of Rome, died in 215 BC while the Romans were locked in a life-and-death struggle with Hannibal 
of Carthage. Hieron&apos;s son, Gelon, had predeceased him so the throne of Syracuse passed to his grandson, Hieronymos, a youth of only fifteen. 
The Carthaginian faction in Syracuse persuaded the new ruler to renounce the Roman alliance, which his grandfather had so steadfastly 
maintained, but this soon resulted in a revolution at Syracuse in which Hieronymos and all the members of his family perished. The young 
king had reigned for a mere thirteen months. Democratic government was reestablished, but the following year the Romans laid siege to the 
city, and it was sacked following its fall in 211, thus bringing to an end almost three centuries of Syracusan preeminence in the affairs of 
Greek Sicily. 

The three-year period of the restored democracy saw a surprisingly large and varied output of coinage, all the more remarkable as the city was 
under siege by the Romans throughout most of this episode. The coinage was quite diverse in its denominations, and used all metals: gold, 
silver, and bronze. Gold is only known in 60 litrai, an extremely rare issue. In contrast, the Fifth Democracy silver is exceptionally diverse, 
with multiples of 2½, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 16 litrai. The bronze also has multiple denominations. Throughout the series, the types featured 
nearly all of the deities who ever graced a Syracusan coin, perhaps in an attempt to appeal to as many of the Olympian gods as possible while 
the city was imperiled.

Eminakos is known only from his coins. Most authors speculate that he was a local dynast based in Olbia, which is almost certainly the mint 
for this issue, as the types appear on other coins of Olbia and almost all examples known have been found in the vicinity of that city (see G. F. 
Hill, op cit, pp. 117-8). In his 1968 doctoral thesis, Karyshkovskij noted 21 known staters of this type, to which a few have been added over 
the past 48 years. It would seem, thus, that this is not an extremely rare coinage, but the vast majority are in public collections; they very rarely 
appear at auction -only two examples are in CoinArchives, sold in 2012 and 2014, over a decade after the previous example, the Kunstfreund 
specimen sold in Leu 76 in 1999.

This coin type had long been ascribed to the Bisaltai, one of the powerful Thraco-Macedonian tribes that struck coinage in the late 6th and 
early 5th centuries. The weight of the evidence now points to it being the earliest issue of Alexander I, when he was allied with the tribes 
against the Persians; he presumably struck coins with types that were acceptable to his allies and would, in fact, symbolize their alliance.

($100,000) 

From the Ghazzat/Gaza 1960s hoard. 

The Ghazzat Hoard was found in the sea off the coast of Gaza in the 1960s. The coins from the hoard have been consigned by the Tarazi 
family, who acquired the coins immediately after they were found. In recognition of the importance of the hoard for scholars, the Tarazi family 
offered 27 of the hoard&apos;s 29 coins as a single lot in Triton XIX (lot 82). As we noted in the descritption of that lot, the present two Delphi 
tridrachms were retained by the family; they were not previously sold, as reported in the recent publication of this hoard in AJN 27 (2015). See 
the online description of these lots for a full discussion of the history and composition of this significant hoard. 

The tridrachms of Delphi are among the most historically interesting of all Greek coins. Prior to the Asyut find they were only known from 
two coins in Paris and Berlin, as well as a fragment from the Zagazig Hoard of 1901 (IGCH 1645); now there are at least 14 examples. The 
fact that almost all the known examples were found in Egypt suggests that the unusual weight standard might have been chosen specifically 
with Egyptian trade in mind. The obverse type is a direct reference to the Greek victory over the Persians at Plataea in 479, when a great deal 
of booty, including silver vessels, was taken by the Greeks. These two rhyta were certainly from that booty and must have been brought as 
a dedication to Apollo in Delphi (rams were sacred to Apollo, along with dolphins). The reverse of this coin is also very unusual: it is not 
a normal quadripartite incuse but, rather, clearly shows the stepped coffering that we know decorated ancient ceilings, especially those of 
prestigious buildings like that of the Temple of Apollo. The dolphins that ornament these coffers make the identification sure as they are a play 
on both the name of Delphi and on the fact that Apollo himself could appear in the form of a Dolphin.

The historical context of the Athenian dekadrachms, as well as concomitant tetradrachms and didrachms of the same class, has been the 
matter of extended debate. Much of the early confusion stems from a passage in Herodotos, who said that Athens paid ten drachms to each 
of its citizens for surpluses from the Laurion mines (7.144.1). Although this passage appeared to provide easy historical evidence for the 
dekadrachm issue, not every scholar was convinced. It was Ernest Beulé who was the first to raise the chronological question of the issue, 
and from whom all subsequent research stemmed. Taken in context, the passage in Herodotos would place such an issue shortly after the 
victory at Marathon in 490 BC, a date that was accepted for the dekadrachm issue by prominent early numismatists, Babelon (Traité II, col. 
769-770) and Head (HN, pp. 370-371), but which subsequent scholarship has shown to be far too early. Although Gardner retained the 490 
BC date of issue in keeping with Babelon (A History of Ancient Coinage, 700-300 BC, p. 162), he added to the discussion by recognizing 
that the Athenian dekadrachms were contemporary with those of Syracuse, which he identified with the Demareteia mentioned in the ancient 
sources and dated to the immediate period following the battle of Himera in 480 BC. Seltman, in his major work on the pre-Persian coinage 
of Athens, rejected Babelon&apos;s conclusions. Yet, he also failed to put credence in the views of Gardner and subsequently placed the issue far 
too early, in the later 480s BC. Almost immediately, this view came under fire. Robinson saw Salamis as the occasion for issue (NC [1924], 
pp. 338-340), and Regling, in his revised edition of Sallet&apos;s Die antiken Münzen, viewed the combined victories of Salamis and Plataiai as 
the occasion. It was Kraay (NC [1956], p. 55; ACGC, pp. 66-68) who, paying attention to the evidence of the hoards, noted that Seltman&apos;s 
chronology was far too early; yet, he failed to convince his critics. Starr, whose own study of Athenian coinage also relied on the evidence of 
the hoards, confirmed some of what Kraay had argued, and suggested that the occasion for the issue of the dekadrachms was the battle near 
the river Eurymedon (circa 469/5 BC). The subsequent discovery of the Asyut Hoard (IGCH 1644) in 1968/9 and the Elmalı Hoard (CH VIII, 
48) in 1984, confirmed a mid-460s BC date. 

Various interpretations of the dekadrachms&apos; purpose have also been proposed. Although Fischer-Bossert suggests that the size of the issue 
indicates an economic, rather that ceremonial purpose, Head, much of whose work had formed the basis of dekadrachm scholarship, thought 
they were special, ceremonial issues struck at various times for &quot;the personal gratification of Tyrants or Kings&quot;, and were not part of the actual 
currency. As seen above, Starr&apos;s survey of the Athenian coinage, and his confirmation of Kraay&apos;s earlier conclusions, rejected this earlier 
conception. It seems clear that such an exceptional and compact issue must have served some special function. Recent scholars have focused 
on two key historical events during this period that could have produced sizable quantities of silver for this series: the battle of the Eurymedon 
River in 467 BC, where the resulting captured Persian booty was enormous and was attested to have been distributed (Plutarch, Vit. Cim. 
13.6-8), and the capture of Thasos and its mines in 463/2 BC, where the plunder is assumed to have been substantial (Plutarch, op. cit. 14.2). 

The dekadrachms stand apart from the typical Athenian coinage not only by their massive size, but the transformation of the reverse type 
from an owl in profile to one facing the viewer. One cannot fail to notice the power in such a portrayal, which clearly is a representation of 
the growing Athenian military might that produced the victory over the Persians at the Eurymedon River and the later capture of the bountiful 
Thasian mines.

The Electrum Coinage of Kyzikos 

The celebrated electrum coinage of Kyzikos began in the first half of the sixth century, and from the beginning the coinage was notable for 
the variety and inventiveness of its designs. These staters and fractions were regarded as gold coins and circulated throughout a large area 
along with the gold darics of the Persian Empire. On all of the coins of Kyzikos, large or small, was engraved the tunny-fish (θυννος), 
which constituted an important product in the Kyzikene economy. The long awaited corpus initiated by the late Friedrich Bodenstedt is now 
being continued by Maria Kaiser-Raiss. In the meantime, we must rely on the synthesis of material put together by Hans von Fritze in 1914, 
augmented (and corrected) by the articles by Sylvia Hurter and Hans-Joachim Liewald. Hurter studied the electrum coinage of Kyzikos for 
some time before her untimely death in 2008. It was her conviction that the arrangement of the coins by Agnes Baldwin Brett in the catalog of 
the Boston Museum of Fine Arts was the most accurate to date (reflected in the &quot;Editor&apos;s note&quot; at the beginning of the article on the Kyzikene 
coins in Moscow and St. Petersburg in SNR 2007). Thus, the coinage of Kyzikos below is arranged accordingly. 

More controversially, Yuri Pokras (&quot;A New Iconography for the Electrum Coins of Kyzikos,&quot; The Celator November 2000, pp.18-26) has 
tried to argue that Athens invested Kyzikos with the status of subsidiary mint, and that the presence of specific types parallels each city-state&apos;s 
inclusion into an alliance with Athens. 

The orator Aristotelis, in the second century BC, stated the following in his speech regarding the people of Kyzikos: &quot;It is enough for one 
just to glance at the location and the nature of this city to immediately understand that the name &apos;blissful&apos; given to it by God was factual, so 
convenient is its land and its sea. As it is built in front of Asia Minor and since its dominion extends from the Black Sea to the Hellespont, 
Kyzikos joins the two seas together or rather all the seas that man navigates. Thus, ships continuously pass by or arrive at the harbor or depart 
from the harbor. Justly it should be called &apos;blissful&apos; just as is Corinth because, as it is built in the mid part of the seas, it joins, as if it was the 
center of the world, all men who sail the Mediterranean from Gibraltar to Kolchis at the far side of the Black Sea.&quot;

Von Fritze 42, like some of the electrum issues of Kyzikos, is very similar to another issue, von Fritze 84, and can only be distinguished by 
subtle elements of the style. Here, the lion is poised with both front feet on the tunny, its jaws wide open, and the tail curved down between 
its hind legs. In contrast, on type 84, the lion has one forepaw raised, its mouth is only slightly opened, and its tail hangs down behind the tail 
of the tunny. While type 84 is relatively common, coins of type 42 are very rare.

The myth of Erichthonios places him at the beginning of the line of Athenian kings. Born of Gaia through Hephaestus, the infant was entrusted 
to Athena, who gave him to the daughters of Kekrops of Athens in a sealed casket. When they opened the casket, the sight of the anguipedic 
(serpent-footed) Erichthonios drove the women to madness, and they hurled themselves off the Acropolis. Erichthonios was then left to 
found a new dynasty of the early kings of Athens. Although here the child is shown fully human, this rare Kyzikene stater is undoubtedly a 
representation of the beginning of this tale.

This issue is one of the very rare examples of a legend appearing on one of the many electrum issues of Mytilene, and it is even more 
exceptional in that it is not an ethnic, but an identifier of the figure depicted on the coin. As Hurter noted in her article publishing this type that 
was unknown to Bodenstedt, it certainly commemorates a specific, yet unknown, event, though it was likely a victory that was local in nature.

Coinage at Lydia 

296. 
KINGS of LYDIA. temp. Ardys -Alyattes. Circa 630s-564/53 BC. EL Trite -Third Stater (13.5mm, 4.76 g). 
Sardes mint. Confronted lion heads; µ5Òåkuk between / Two square punches. Wallace, KUKALIṂ, pl. I, 1-4; Weidauer Group 
XVIII (unlisted denomination); Traité -; SNG Kayhan -; SNG von Aulock -; Triton XV, lot 1241 = Nomos 8, lot 187. EF, 
toned. Rare. 
($10,000) 

This rare issue, with the nearly full legend KUKALIṂ, has been the object of much scholarly debate. At the time of Weidauer&apos;s study, 
she argued that the names WALWET and […]KALIL[…] (the full legend was then unknown), are not the names of kings but more likely 
the names of magistrates. Since Weidauer&apos;s publication, other examples have come to light, allowing the full legend to be discerned as 
KUKALIṂ, which translates to &quot;I [belong] to Kukaś&quot; (for a detailed linguistic explanation of how this conclusion was reached, see Wallace, 
KUKALIṂ, p. 38). The Lydian name Kukaś could be transliterated into Greek as Gyges (Γύγης), just as the WALWET could be transliterated 
into Greek as Alyattes (Ἀλυάττης). Although G.M. Browne (&quot;A new Lydian text,&quot; Kadmos 39 [2000], pp. 178-9) found it attractive to assign 
those coins with the KUKALIṂ legend to the early Lydian king Gyges (circa 680-644 BC), Wallace has shown on numismatic grounds 
that this cannot be correct. Observing punch links between hektai with the KUKALIṂ legend (Weidauer Group XVIII) and those with the 
WALWET legend (Weidauer Group XVII), as well as visible signs of wear and damage on these same punches between the two series, 
Wallace argues that the WALWET and KUKALIṂ issues were roughly contemporary. Thus, the Kukaś of the KUKALIṂ coinage was a 
close contemporary of Alyattes named Gyges, rather than the earlier Lydian king of the same name. Most likely this Kukaś was a member of 
the Lydian royal family, since the design for the anvil die may have derived from a royal seal showing opposing lion heads. Wallace further 
argues that there are two distinct groupings within the larger Lydian series, which can be attributed to separate mints, with the KUKALIṂ 
coins belonging to the group he assigns to a subsidiary, or &quot;branch&quot;, mint. If these coins were struck by a subsidiary Lydian mint in one of 
the territories it controlled (cf. Herodotos 1.6.1), then Kukaś may have been its governor, just as Kroisos had been in Adramytion before he 
became king of Lydia (Nic. Dam. FGrH. 90, fr. 65). 

While Wallace&apos;s evidence for the contemporaiety of the WALWET and KUKALIṂ coinage is firmly based, his evidence for the two groupings 
is speculative, and not convincing. First, he speculates that there are two forms of obverse dies, one with two opposing lion heads separated 
by the signature, and another form that shows only one lion head before which is the signature. An inspection of the published examples, 
however, shows this is probably incorrect. Whenever there is sufficient space on the dies to show whether there is an opposing head on the 
die, an opposing head is always present (cf. Weidauer 91-94, 97-98, and 100-102). All other examples do only show a single lion head, but all 
of these have flans that are too small to see whether another head is opposite the one that is visible (cf. Weidauer 95-96 and 99). It is therefore 
most likely that all of the trite and hekte dies feature two opposing heads separated by the signature. Wallace also argues that there is a distinct 
stylistic difference between the two groupings, with the &quot;branch&quot; mint group having a more &quot;primitive and rustic&quot; style. Again, an inspection 
of the published examples renders this subjective observation moot, as there is a wide variation of style across all of the dies, from which one 
may discern multiple groupings. What is more likely is that the dies were created by a variety of engravers, whose styles varied somewhat 
from one another. In sum, the WALWET and KUKALIṂ coinage were all likely struck contemporaneously during the reigns of Ardys or 
Allyates, at a single mint in the captial Sardes. The translation of the names, WALWET to Allyates and KUKALIṂ to Gyges, is certain, but 
the identification of these individuals and the reason for their use on this series are as yet unknown.

series feature the same confronted lion and bull foreparts on the obverse, and two incuse punches (or a single punch in the case of small 
denominations) on the reverse. It is thought that the series began on a &apos;heavy&apos; standard, with gold and silver staters of equal weight, around 
10.6-10.7 grams, which was later reduced to about 8.17 grams for the gold. More recently, though, studies have shown that coins of both 
standards circulated together, but that the heavy standard was only used for a relatively short time compared to the light standard, which 
continued to be used into the Persian period. The Kroiseids have also traditionally been broken down into two stylistic groups, &apos;realistic&apos; and 
&apos;stylized&apos;, with hoard evidence suggesting that the former belonged to the time of Kroisos, while the latter were of the time of the Persians. 
The present coin, however, is from an issue that constitutes a third group that has a more archaic style, which has features that suggest it is the 
first issue of Kroisos&apos; bimetallic coinage. 

This prototype issue was first noted and analyzed in an article by Paolo Naster in 1964 (&quot;Une série aberrante de Créséides&quot; in BSFN 19 
(1964), pp. 364-5, reprinted in P. Naster, Scripta Nummaria: Contributions à la méthodologie numismatique [Louvian-la-Neuve, 1983], pp. 
76-7). The archaic character of the type is most evident in the bull, where the fine waves of hair on the later coinage are here represented as 
a series of pelleted lines emanating from a solid arc that forms the animal&apos;s neckline. At the same time, antecedents of the style of the lion 
can be seen in the earlier electum coinage, particularly the hemihektai of Wiedauer&apos;s Group XVI. The most significant feature linking this 
issue to the electrum, though, is the appearance of the small pellet or protuberance on the head of the lion. This feature, usually featuring rays 
emanating from it, is canonical on all the earlier electrum coinage from the time of Ardys until the early part of Kroisos&apos; reign. It is a feature 
that is totally lacking on the bimetallic coinage of the &apos;realistic&apos; and, later, &apos;stylized&apos; character. A final unusual feature particular to this issue 
is the depiction of the arms of the lion and bull, which are shown bent nearly 90 degrees at their mid-point, rather than in a straight line from 
shoulder to paw and hoof. 

The extreme rarity today of these early style staters also suggests that the issue was short-lived, perhaps a trial run before the style was 
standardized. Martin Price also noted this unusual emission of staters (&quot;Croesus or Pseudo-Croesus?&quot; in Festschrift Mildenberg, p. 221, n. 
25), and, like Naster, placed them between the electrum and the gold of standard style.

Second Known Halikarnassos Civic Tetradrachm 

303. 
CARIA, Halikarnassos. Circa 400-387 BC. AR Tetradrachm (21.5mm, 15.24 g, 12h). Head of Apollo, wearing 
laurel wreath, facing slightly right / Eagle standing half-right, wings spread; Å¬5˚År@Åss-EW@ around, star to right; all 
within incuse square. Konuk, Identities 22 = Hecatomnus p. 121 = Prospero 533 = Leu 20 (Biaggi), lot 131 = Hunt III 37 = 
Lorber pl. VI, 21 = Hurter pl. VI, F var. (symbol on rev.); otherwise unpublished. Good VF, toned, scattered marks, some die 
rust and mark on nose on obverse. Extremely rare, the second known civic tetradrachm of Halikarnassos, and the only example 
with this symbol. 
($20,000) 

The Apollo-eagle civic coinage of Halikarnassos has been known for some time, in multiple denominations from hemidrachm to tetradrachm, 
but all denominations were extremely rare until a modest quantity of drachms appeared in the Hecatomnus hoard in the late 1970s. This 
coinage was originally thought to have been struck after the Carian satrap Maussollos moved the capital of the satrapy from Mylasa to 
Halikarnassos, but the dating of the Hecatomnus hoard clearly showed that this was not the case; this coinage must have preceded the event. 
The implication of this new arrangement now clarified that Maussollos&apos; new Apollo type coinage was influenced by this civic coinage, and that 
this coinage, in turn, was influenced by the Rhodian facing-head coinage that had been introduced only a couple decades earlier. 

Halkarnassos was well known for its sanctuary of Apollo at the summit of the Zephyrion peninsula, and certainly this deity is the one 
represented on the obverse of this coinage. Some numismatists have attempted to link the Apollo of Halikarnasos with the Apollo-Helios of 
Rhodes, but Konuk (in Identities) points out that the assimilation of the two deities did not occur until the Hellenistic period. The consistent 
use of the laurel wreath on the Apollo heads here also clearly marks this Apollo as being distinct from Apollo-Helios, who is depicted either 
bare headed or radiate. 

All of the coins from this civic issue are rare. In his section on the Halikarnassos coins in the Hecatomnus hoard study, Konuk identified 26 
drachms, two hemidrachms, and one tetradrachm, while CoinArchives adds approximately eight drachms. The present piece brings the total 
census of tetradrachms to two. It should be noted that the subsidiary symbol on this coin is unprecedented, as all of the other coins, in all 
denominations, have an olive branch. This suggests that this coin is part of a second series (or workshop?), perhaps struck in parallel with the 
olive branch coins.

Satraps of Caria 

As part of the Achaemenid Empire, Caria in the fourth century BC was under the rule of a family of semi-independent satraps known as the 
Hekatomnids after the dynasty&apos;s founder, Hekatomnos. Born in Mylasa, Hekatomnos was appointed satrap of Caria by Artaxerxes II after the 
fall of Tissaphernes in 392/1 BC and was later given control of Miletos in 386 BC. Interested in Hellenic culture (and possibly hedging his 
diplomatic bets), Hekatomnos sent his youngest son, Pixodaros, to Athens as part of a deputation; his older son, Maussolos, was bound by 
xenia, or guest friendship, with Agesilaus, king of Sparta. Hekatomnos died in 377/6 BC and was succeeded by Maussolos. 

At the time of Maussolos&apos; accession, Achaemenid power was weakened by the independence of Egypt and a revolt of the subject Kadusioi. As 
a result, the satraps of Asia Minor were able to exercise considerable independence; an opportunity of which Maussolos took full advantage. 
Moving the satrapal capital to Halikarnassos, he fortified the city and allowed its population to increase in size. As part of the civic building 
program, he constructed a massive tomb for himself near the city&apos;s center. Known later as the Mausoleum, its size and elaborate decoration 
made it one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world. In addition, Maussolos moved and refounded the Greek cities of Knidos, Erythrai, and 
Priene. His relations with the Persians took a downturn when he briefly joined the Great Satrap Revolt, a series of rebellions that continued 
to spring up in the Persian Empire throughout the 360s, all of which ultimately failed. For the remainder of his rule thereafter, Maussolos 
continued to act more or less independently, although he had to accept a Persian garrison in Halikarnassos. During the early years of his reign, 
a new obverse type, featuring the facing head of Apollo/Helios, was introduced. It became the standard obverse type for most of the Carian 
satrapal issues thereafter. Maussolos died in 353/2 BC, and was succeeded by his sister-wife, Artemisia. Her rule, however, was short-lived, 
and in 351/0 BC power passed to Hidrieus, Artemisia&apos;s brother and the second son of Hekatomnos. Hidrieus&apos; reign was also relatively short-
lived, as he contracted a disease and died in 344/3 BC. Rule then passed to another sister, Ada. 

In 341/0 BC, Pixodarus, the youngest son of Hekatomnos, overthrew his sister, Ada, possibly aided by the support of the Persian commander 
of Asia Minor, Mentor of Rhodes. This usurpation did little to endear the new satrap to Artaxerxes III, who had recently approved Ada&apos;s 
appointment following the death of her husband, Hidrieus. Ada, nevertheless, continued to receive support from the countryside, and still held 
the city of Alinda. As a result, Caria was thrown into turmoil and hesitated to support Persia following the invasion of the Macedonians under 
Parmenion in 336 BC. This non-support of their nominal overlord was also compounded by the secret negotiations of alliance that Pixodaros 
had been conducting with the Macedonian king. In 337 BC, Pixodaros attempted a marriage between one of his daughters and the future Philip 
III Arridaios. Believing himself overlooked, Philip&apos;s elder son, Alexander III, sent a private embassy to Halikarnassos, asking for the hand 
of the same princess. When word of this reached Philip II, he cancelled the Macedonian-Carian alliance. Pixodaros died of natural causes in 
336/5 BC, and was succeeded by Orontobates, an otherwise unknown Persian, who apparently married the princess Pixodaros had attempted 
to betroth to Philip III. The fate of Orontobates is uncertain, but after Caria was conquered by Alexander III in 332 BC, the Macedonian king 
made diplomatic overtures to Ada, and reappointed her as satrap. 

Koray Konuk is presently preparing his Ph.D. dissertation, a detailed analysis of the coins of the Hekatomnids, for a forthcoming RNS 
publication, &quot;The Coinage of the Hekatomnids in Caria.&quot;

The city-kingdom of Paphos, located on the western coast of Cyprus, was in existence since at least the late Bronze Age, and was particularly 
prosperous through trade conducted with the Minoans, Mycenaeans, and cities along the Levantine coast. The earliest coins date to the late 
sixth century BC, and production, almost exclusively in silver, continued through most of the successive kings, until the abolition of the 
Cypriot kingdoms under Ptolemy I. Timarchos was the son of Timocharis, and succeeded to the throne circa 350 BC. He was the first king of 
Paphos to strike coins in gold, and was the first to use the Greek alphabet on his coinage. The appearance of Aphrodite and her dove on the 
gold coins of Timarchos refer to the cult of Aphrodite for which Paphos was an important center; its sanctuary was one of the most significant 
shrines of the ancient world, and remained active through the Roman period. The king of Paphos also served as the cult&apos;s chief priest. During 
the time of Alexander, Timarchos was one of the Cypriot kings who joined with the Macedonian during the great siege of Tyre, and was 
allowed to retain his kingdom in exchange. Timarchos died in 325 BC, and was succeed by his son, Nikokles.

The coins of Andragoras (gold staters and tetradrachms) have been objects of controversy since both types were first reported from the 
Oxus hoard. The identification of the issuer has been a matter of debate. Justin mentions two people by the name of Andragoras: (1) a noble 
Persian appointed by Alexander the Great as governor of Parthia (xii.4.12), and (2) a Seleukid governor of Parthia about the middle of the 3rd 
century who was defeated by Arsakes (xli.4.7). It has been suggested that the gold belongs to the first Andragoras and the silver to the second 
Andragoras (see Rapson in NC 1893, pp. 204-206), but most scholars prefer to attribute both coinages to the same issuer, and the presence 
of the same monogram on the gold and silver would seem to confirm this view. George Francis Hill, after a comprehensive study of all the 
evidence (BMC Arabia cxlviii-clx), favored a date for the coinage in the late 4th century to the early 3rd century, which would be consistent 
with an issue by the first Andragoras, who was appointed as governor of Persia by Alexander the Great, but may well have remained in his 
position for some time. More recent scholarship, however, has convincingly shown that the coins were struck by the second Andragoras. (For 
the most detailed and current study on Andragoras, his position in the history of the region, and his coinage, see Jeffrey D. Lerner, The Impact 
of Seleucid Decline on the Eastern Iranian Plateau [Stuttgart, 1999], pp. 13-31.)

Due to a number of political miscalculations by the Macedonians in the period following the conquest of the old Achaemenid Empire by 
Alexander III of Macedon, many loyal Persians must have felt embittered, and resistance to Macedonian power may already have begun before 
the invaders left to pacify the eastern Achaemenid satrapies and then attack India. These problems were exacerbated by Alexander&apos;s Seleukid 
successors. Sometime during the mid-third century BC, revolts broke out in the eastern Seleukid territories of Baktria (under Diodotos I), 
in Parthia and Hyrkania under Andragoras, who was subsequently defeated and killed by Arsakes I. The difficulty in establishing just who 
Andragoras was and what role he played in the events of the region during the mid-third century BC is due to the scarcity of contemporary 
evidence, apart from his coins. What literary evidence exists derives from the later Greco-Roman historians of Alexander (Arrian and 
Curtius), as well as the first century AD historian, Pompeius Trogus (known later through Justin). One possible contemporary piece of 
evidence -a Greek inscription from Gurgan -mentions an Andragoras as a high official under Antiochos I (see J. Wolski, &quot;Andragoras était-il 
Iranien ou Grec?&quot; Studia Iranica 4 [1975], pp. 166-69). During his brief rule, Andragoras may have formed a diplomatic alliance with the 
breakaway Baktrians under Diodotos I, and issued his gold and silver coinage. While most of his known coinage employed the Greek legend 
ANPAΓOPOY, this legend was apparently abandoned in favor of one that was more localized. On two staters his name was transliterated into 
Aramaic as &apos;nrgwr, while the epithet wḥšwwr -a reference to his association with the local god Vaxšu -was included on the reverse (see I.M. 
Diakonoff and E.V. Zeimal, &quot;Pravitel &apos;Parfii Andragor i ego monet,&quot; VDI 4 [1988], pp. 4-19). Likely this shift was the result of Andragoras&apos; 
precarious political situation and an attempt to foster support for his rule among the local populace. Andragoras&apos; territory was overrun from 
the north by the nomadic Parni (who became the Parthians), and he was defeated and killed by Arsakes I, who thereafter founded the Arsakid 
dynasty of the now independent kingdom of Parthia. 

The authenticity of Andragoras&apos; coins has occasioned at least equal debate. The first published coin of Andragoras (no. 1 above) was reportedly 
from the Oxus treasure, and other coins of Andragoras soon came onto the market. However, doubts about authenticity were expressed in 
respect to some of the reported specimens, based on the fact that many, if not all, of the Oxus finds passed through the hands of the Rawalpindi 
goldsmiths, who made copies that were sold into the market along with the genuine items. Cunningham, who published a description in 1881 
of the coins that were said to come from the Oxus hoard (J.A.S.B., 1881, pp. 169-182), said that he had seen no fewer than seven forgeries of 
Andragoras gold staters. He had two Andragoras gold staters in his own cabinet that he believed to be genuine, but only one came to the British 
Museum with his collection (no. 2 in the list above). 

Hill changed his view over time about the authenticity of the Cunningham gold stater (no. 2 above). In his article in the Atti Memorie dell&apos; 
Istituto Italiano di Numismatica 3 (1919), pp. 23-33, Hill expressed doubt about the coin&apos;s authenticity. However, by the time he wrote the 
BMC Arabia volume in 1922, he had been persuaded that his doubts were not justified (p. cxlviii, note 2). Hill apparently had been troubled 
by the fact that the obverses of the two British Museum specimens (nos. 1 and 2 above) were struck from obverse dies that were extremely 
similar yet not quite the same, noting that &quot;although the obverses are almost line for line the same, the head on the Cunningham coin is on a 
much larger scale and in flatter relief&quot; (p. cli). We will return to the Cunningham coin below. 

In 1994, Professor Osmund Bopearachchi examined and authenticated the present coin. He noted that, while making investigations in Pakistan 
on the second Mir Zakah deposit, he had learned from a reliable source that the present coin was found in that deposit along with two other 
Andragoras gold staters (private letter, 8 November 1999). We can now surmise that the examples listed initially above as nos. 4 and 5, which 
later appeared in trade, are the other two coins -in addition to the present coin -from the second Mir Zakah deposit. However, when the 
present coin was offered in trade in London in the 1990s, it was taken to the British Museum for comparison and was found to differ from the 
Cunningham example, which was apparently from the same dies but on which the design details were larger. This difference in design size 
raised doubts about the authenticity of the present coin. 

Recently, we undertook to revisit the question of authenticity that had arisen following the comparison of the present coin with the Cunningham 
example, and we took the present coin and the example listed above as no. 5 (kindly provided by the owner) to the British Museum for direct 
comparison with the two examples in the Museum collection. The results were illuminating. 

Comparing the four available coins (nos. 1, 2, 5, and 6 above), it is clear that all four were from the same obverse die, based on the identity not 
only of design details but also on the identity of numerous small die flaws and die irregularities that simply could not be the same on different 
dies. All but one (no. 1) were from the same reverse die. The no. 1 example, with a different reverse die from all other known examples, was 
actually a later strike than any of the other pieces, for the obverse die has developed two new die flaws behind the head: a linear flaw projecting 
diagonally from the hair left into the field, and a small horizontal flaw just above the monogram. In addition, the obverse detail is overall less 
crisp than on the other coins. 

However, we noted --as Hill had noted earlier (see above) -that the Cunningham example had a significantly larger design than the other three 
examples. We measured fixed points in the obverse design on the four coins and found that coins 1, 5, and 6 were identical in measurement to 
each other but that the Cunningham piece has a design that is approximately 5% larger than the others. 

Leaving the Cunningham piece aside for a moment, the other three coins formed a clear progression. The present coin, no. 6, had the sharpest 
obverse detail. No. 5 had slightly less sharp detail on both sides, apparently the result of die wear, and must be a somewhat later strike. No. 1, 
as noted above, was clearly an even later strike, when significant flaws had developed in the obverse die and the reverse die had been replaced. 
Among the three coins, the fabric as well as the design details seemed consistent, and our opinion is that all three coins appear to be genuine. 

The Cunningham piece was anomalous not only in the size of the design, but in addition the shape of the flan appears slightly distorted or 
bowed. How can these anomalies be explained? One suggestion is that perhaps the Cunningham piece was once placed under pressure in 
some way that caused the coin to spread slightly. There is no apparent damage to confirm this, but the slight distortion in shape may support 
this theory. We do not express any further conclusion here on the Cunningham example, except to note -as Hill did in 1919 -that it has 
characteristics difficult to reconcile with the other known examples. 

The final argument in favor of the authenticity of the three examples reportedly from Mir Zakah (nos. 4-6 above including the present piece) 
is that there is no known model from which they could have been made. The only other known examples from the same dies are nos. 2 and 3 
above, but those are both in lesser condition and could not have served as the model. Accordingly, there seems no convincing reason to doubt 
the authenticity of the three Mir Zakah specimens.

Prototype Shekel of the First Jewish War 
Finest Known of Three Examples 

358. 
JUDAEA, Jewish War. 66-70 CE. AR Shekel (22.5mm, 14.18 g, 11h). Protoype issue. Jerusalem mint. Dated year 1 
(66/7 CE). Omer cup; ! (&quot;1&quot; in Hebrew = date) above, pellets flanking, L!Rc¥ LQc (&quot;Shekel of Israel&quot; in Hebrew) around, 
between concentric dotted circle borders / Sprig of three pomegranates; YcrQ 2Lcur¥ (&quot;Jerusalem [the] holy&quot; in Hebrew) 
around, between concentric dotted circle borders. Meshorer 183; Kadman 1; Hendin 1352; Bromberg 56 = Shoshana I 20195 
(same dies); Sofaer -; Spaer -. EF, toned, original patina, slightly off center on reverse. The third, and finest, known, one of 
which is in a public collection (Jerusalem). The Shoshana/Bromberg piece hammered at $925,000 in 2012. ($750,000) 

From an American collection. 

This is one of three known examples of a prototype for the shekel of the first year of the Jewish War, beginning May 66 (or a bit later), and it is 
therefore the first coin type of the renowned Jewish War shekels and half shekels. One specimen, discussed further below, is in the collection of 
the Israel Museum, Jerusalem. The second specimen was sold in Shoshana I at a hammer of $925,000; the same coin had been sold previously 
in 1991 as part of the Bromberg Collection, and sold there for $242,000. 

This third specimen is the only one of the three that has not been cleaned, and it retains a thin, attractive patina of the silver chlorides typically 
seen on the Jewish shekels. It is also the best struck of the three coins, while all three of them are slightly off-center on the reverse, this 
specimen shows more of the legend than the others. 

In the late 1970&apos;s, Shab&apos;an Wazwaz, a dealer in Old City Jerusalem, offered me a group of six shekels. Three were year 2, two were year 3, 
and the sixth coin was the first known example of this type: Asking price was $6,000. Mr. Wazwaz was a legitimate dealer, but did have the 
reputation of selling the occasional forgery, and so I rejected the deal and instead offered $4,000 for the five shekels, not including the sixth. 
At the time, this type had not been published, and Ya&apos;akov Meshorer had seen the coin and said he believed it was not genuine. I was unable to 
discuss it with Meshorer, because he was not in the country during my visit. I was a &quot;kid&quot; only 10 years into my study, and it looked authentic 
to me, but I was in no position to put up $2,000 for a questionable coin. Upon his return from abroad, Meshorer reviewed the coin again and 
decided to buy it for the collection of the Israel Museum, where he was chief curator of archaeology as well as numismatics.

This remarkable tetradrachm almost certainly is a contemporary issue of the famous unique gold daric in the Paris cabinet employing the 
same types. That piece has had considerable study from various numismatists, most recently by Koray Konuk, who definitively placed the 
issue in Caria. In his 1990 article, he originally dated the issue to the time of Darios III, but recently he has revised his opinion and dated the 
daric to 450-400 BC, based on the similarity of the obverse style to the Carradice Type IIIb A/B darics struck in Sardes. The appearance of 
the present associated tetradrachm, though, requires a change to the chronology, as the tetradrachm must be contemporary with the famous 
Ionian map tetradrachms (see previous lot), which are dated to Circa 350-333 BC. So, downdating this prow issue to the last decades of the 
Persian Empire is reasonable. 

As this issue must have been struck in Caria, within the proposed dates there are only two events possible for this issue. In 345 BC, the Persian 
king, Artaxerxes III, directed the Carian satrap Hidrieus to put down a revolt in Cyprus that had erupted in the aftermath of the Persian defeat 
in Egypt. To accomplish his task, Hidrieus assembled a fleet of 40 triremes and an army of around 8,000 mercenaries. This would require a 
large sum of money, and the naval reference of this issue certainly fits the occasion. The other event is the Persian war against Alexander, 
and the naval campaign undertaken by Memnon of Rhodes, who is sometimes credited with striking the Ionian map issue for this purpose. 
This event, though, seems less likely as the occasion for the prow coinage, since Memnon did not undertake his Aegean strategy until after 
he and Orontobates, the satrap of Caria at that time, fled the citadel of Halikarnassos, which was subsequently beseiged by the Macedonians. 
Although Orontobates left a garrison that held out for some time, it is improbable that Memnon used the mint there, or elsewhere in Caria for 
that matter, to produce coinage to pay for his expenses. 

The question, however, is why would Hidrieus not use his own coinage to accomplish his task, rather than an anonymous Persian issue without 
reference to himself? Perhaps the answer lies within the task itself-did the Persian king provide the silver from his own reserves and thereby 
required Persian types? Or, did the mercenaries, including those manning the ships, demand a form of payment in a coinage that employed 
a general Persian type rather than a local Carian one? It is an interesting question to which we currently lack an answer. Regardless, this is a 
remarkable coinage, and certainly one struck for an historical event of some importance. In the end, Hidrieus was successful in his endeavor; 
the revolt in Cyprus was put down, and the island was restored to Persian control. Unfortunately for Hidrieus, he died almost immediately 
thereafter, perhaps from a disease contracted in the campaign.

This lovely bronze type, while ostensibly displaying Aphrodite holding Eros in her arms, was in fact a dynastic issue, following in the 
Ptolemaic tradition that rulers were represented in the guise of gods. Here, the identification of Kleopatra as Aphrodite is not controversial, as 
the two are often related in classical literature. The choice of this type is relative to its place of the issue, Cyprus, where an important temple 
to Aphodite was located at Paphos. In 48 BC, Julius Caesar gave Cyprus to Kleopatra, and the fact that Caesarion was his son by the Egyptian 
queen lends credence to the identification of Eros as Caesarion on this coin. Literary and epigraphic evidence clearly displays the intent of 
Kleopatra to elevate their son to the status of a co-ruler, and so his presence on the coin would be conventional. Nonetheless, other candidates 
have been suggested, such as either of her sons by Mark Antony, Alexander Helios or Ptolemy Philadelphos. As the coin has no indication of 
date, it could have been struck later, after Kleopatra gave birth to Antony&apos;s children. Two facts, though, suggest that this isolated issue would 
not favor either of these children over Caesarion. In 34 BC, when Antony was celebrating his Armenian &apos;victory&apos; at Alexandreia, Caesarion 
was given a higher status in the event than Antony&apos;s sons. Also, numismatic evidence suggests that Caesarion retained his position as primary 
heir until Kleopatra&apos;s death (see O. Mørkholm, &quot;Ptolemaic Coins and Chonology&quot; in MN 20 [1975]). It seems appropriate that this exceptional 
issue would have been struck in commemoration of Caesarion&apos;s birth in 47 BC, on the island that had just been given to his mother, Kleopatra, 
by his father, Caesar.

Because of the loss of his power and prestige due to the victories of the Byzantine emperor Heraclius, in AD 628, Husrav (Khosrau) II (and 
eighteen of his sons) was assassinated by his son and successor, Kavad (Kvadh) II. Over the next few months, Kavad attempted to initiate 
peace negotiations with the Byzantine emperor, but the Sasanian king&apos;s death only a few months into the new reign precipitated a period of 
civil war. Kavad&apos;s son and co-ruler, the seven-year-old Ardaxšīr (Ardashir) III, was killed by the Husrav&apos;s former general, Shahrbaraz, but he 
too was soon removed. This vacancy on the throne was filled by two daughters of Husrav II, each of whom ruled for about a year, whether on 
their own, or as possible regents for Husrav (Khosrau) III. The first, Boran, attempted to restore stability to the Sasanian empire by making 
peace with the Byzantines, reducing taxation, and revitalizing the governmental infrastructure, including restoring a general sense of justice. 
All of these moves did little to restore the power of the central government. Her sister and successor, Āzarmīg-duxt (Āzarmīdokht), reigned 
for only a few months. According to the ninth-century Persian historian, al-Tabari, the general Farrokh sought her hand in marriage (and, 
thus, a link to the throne), but she had him murdered. In retaliation, Farrokh&apos;s son, thought to be Rostam Farrokhzad, had her blinded and 
subsequently killed after she was captured at Ctesiphon.

This coin depicts an interesting scene that was repeated by two other emperors and was obviously of great local significance. While sometimes 
thought to depict the local myth of King Tereus being served the corpse of his son in revenge for his crimes against his sister-in-law, the serpent 
or serpent-entwined staff beneath the couch has led others to identify the central figures as Asclepius and Hygeia. A fuller understanding of 
this scene unfortunately eludes us.

In the Fourth Labor, Hercules was charged with capturing the Erymanthian Boar. The beast resided in a grove sacred to Artemis near Mount 
Erymanthus in Arcadia, and would descend from the wilderness to wreck havoc on the surrounding farms and groves. 

During his hunt for the Boar, Hercules visited his friend, the centaur Pholus, who lived in a cave on the mountain. The centaur provided the 
hungry and thirsty hero with food, but shied from offering him the wine he had because it did not belong to him, and was for the use of all the 
centaurs. Hercules, nevertheless, opened the jar, and, smelling the wine&apos;s aroma, the other centaurs became excited and intoxicated. A fight 
soon ensued, and Hercules slew a number of centaurs with arrows poisoned by the blood of the Hydra. During the melee, another of Hercules&apos; 
friends, the kindly centaur Chiron, was accidentally wounded. Although Chiron did not die, as he was immortal, he did experience great pain. 
Hercules attempted to medicate the wound, but his efforts were of little avail. In return for his kindness, however, Chiron offered advice to 
the hero as to how he could capture the Boar. 

Now back on task after his disastrous dawdling, Hercules trapped the Boar by pursuing it through the mountain snows until the creature 
collapsed from exhaustion. Netting the animal, he carried it back to Tiryns and presented it to Eurystheus. Frightened by the Boar, Eurystheus 
hid himself in a large bronze crater, as is depicted here. This scene is well known from an Attic Black-Figure vase of the late sixth century 
BC in the David M. Robinson Collection in the University of Mississippi (D.M. Robinson, &quot;Unpublished Greek Vases in the Robinson 
Collection,&quot; AJA 60.1 [January 1956], 12, and pl. 8).

Because he had been assisted in completing some of his earlier tasks, Hercules was compelled to undergo two more labors. The first of these 
was to steal the Apples of the Hesperides, nymphs who lived in a grove at the far western edge of the world. Hercules tricked the Titan Atlas, 
whose task it was to support the heavens, to retrieve the apples in return for holding up the heavens while he did so. Having accomplished the 
task, Atlas was reluctant to give up his freedom and told Hercules that he would take back the apples to Mycenae. Once again, Hercules tricked 
the Titan, requesting that Atlas hold the heavens while Hercules adjusted his cloak to be more comfortable.

Ex Triton XVI (7 January 2013), lot 687. 

The interesting series of medallions celebrating the Pythian Games in Philippopolis inform us that the commune of Thracians had organized 
the games in honor of the emperor, no doubt in AD 214 during his journey through Thrace on his way to campaign against the Parthians. To 
further flatter the emperor (that is, if he himself was not responsible for this change), the games were now titled &quot;Alexandrian&quot; after Alexander 
the Great, with whom Caracalla was increasingly identifying himself. The historian Herodian (8.1.1-2) provides us with a glimpse of the 
emperor&apos;s obsession with Alexander at precisely this time: 

Caracalla, after attending to matters in the garrison camps along the Danube river, went down into Thrace at the Macedonian border, and 
immediately he became Alexander the Great. To revive the memory of the Macedonian in every possible way, he ordered statues and paintings 
of his hero to be put on public display in all cities. He filled the Capitol, the rest of the temples, indeed, all Rome, with statues and paintings 
designed to suggest that he was a second Alexander. 

At times we saw ridiculous portraits, statues with one body which had on each side of a single head the faces of Alexander and the emperor. 
Caracalla himself went about in Macedonian dress, affecting especially the broad sun hat and short boots. He enrolled picked youths in a unit 
which he labeled his Macedonian phalanx; its officers bore the names of Alexander&apos;s generals.

The Boukephalas Collection of Coins of the Macedonian Koinon 

447. 
MACEDON, Koinon of Macedon. 3rd century AD. Lot of eighty-four (84) pieces. Includes 83 bronze coins 
of the Koinon of Macedon (Macedonian League) as well as 1 lead token. All obverses depict Alexander the Great -either 
diademed, helmeted, or wearing lion&apos;s skin headdress -while the reverses feature a wide variety of designs, often alluding 
to the Macedonian king or the Alexandreian games. Gaebler (AMNG) dated this highly interesting series from Elagabalus to 
Philip I and recorded an astounding 537 individual varieties. Fine-Near EF.

catalogue be sent to you. Additionally, this catalogue will be available online at http://boukephalas.cngcoins.com. 

A note from the consignor: 

Early in 2005 I visited the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, to see the exhibition Longing for Alexander -the changing image of Alexander the 
Great on Greek and Roman coins. I had no expectation of a new enthusiasm being generated -but surprises are part of life&apos;s fun. The depiction 
of Alexander on coinage was not my collecting area but I was reasonably familiar it. As a child, I&apos;d fallen under the spell of Alexander-what 
horse-lover could fail to be entranced by the story of how the Thessalian Philoneikos brought an intractable horse to Philip of Macedon to try 
out and how his young son understood the stallion&apos;s fear and built a relationship that lasted until Boukephalas&apos; death around the age of thirty in 
faraway India. (My preference for the more musical form Boukephalas stems from reading Mary Renault&apos;s novels in my teens -and as that&apos;s 
the version in Plutarch, I see no reason to abandon it.) 

There was, however, a group of coins at the Ashmolean with which I was completely unfamiliar -bronze coins issued in the first half of the 
third century AD by the Koinon of the Macedonians. My eye was caught by a dynamic reverse in which the young Alexander faces a rearing 
Boukephalas to offer him the bridle -not the safest place to stand under those flailing hooves, but the two figures leaning in towards each 
other made a satisfyingly well-balanced and vigorous triangular design. I left the exhibition determined to research this coinage that focused 
on Macedon&apos;s glorious past. The persistence of tradition always fascinates me -and here the Koinon was harking back to events of the 
fourth century BC, more than five hundred years earlier. On the one hand, the Koinon was making a statement about their perception of their 
Macedonian identity. But the choice of Alexander perhaps also reflected imperial concerns: the Alexander coinage began under Elagabalus, 
whose legitimacy depended on his claim that Caracalla was his father. Caracalla&apos;s veneration for Alexander was well known. At this period, 
moreover, Rome often faced conflict on its eastern borders with first the Parthians, then their successors the Sasanians, a conflict that was often 
presented as a modern parallel to Alexander&apos;s conquest of the Persians. 

First of all, I tracked down (not cheaply!) and had specially bound what is still the &quot;bible&quot; for this series, even though it is over a century old, 
the appropriate volume of Hugo Gaebler&apos;s Die Antiken Münzen Nord-Griechenlands. His chronology, worked out by examining die combina-
tions and variations in the neocorate title on the reverse, is still valid. Only a very few coins bear an Actian date -ЄOC -otherwise dating 
must be deduced from internal evidence. 

The Koinon of the Macedonians was the political institution responsible for governing the province in the Roman period. Based in Beroia, it 
was made up of representatives from all over the province. It issued coinage in its own name, and also very rarely in the name of Beroia. From 
218 AD, during the reign of Elagabalus, until the late 240s when Macedonian provincial coinage ended, the Koinon virtually abandoned its 
former practice of putting the emperor&apos;s portrait on the obverse. Instead, they replaced him with the head or bust of Alexander. Sometimes it 
is uncertain whether a male head on provincial coinage in the Roman period is intended to represent Alexander or some other mythical or he-
roic personage. Not here -Alexander is always identified by name. It is also remarkable how consistent the Alexander coinage of the Koinon 
remains over a period of almost thirty years. The issuers have a clear idea of how they wish to depict their hero from their own ancient history. 

The historical context for highlighting Alexander on the coinage was the festivals in honour of Alexander, established under Elagabalus and 
held annually in Beroia, which were known as the Alexandreia. The associated games included horse races, athletic contests, and musical 
competitions. They were of considerable economic importance, as they attracted not only local athletes and merchants but also visitors from 
outside the province. Under Gordian III, the games were granted the same status (and prize money) as those held at Olympia -a title recorded 
on some of the coins. These &quot;Olympian&quot; games, however, were held only twice, in 242/3 and 246/7. 

I never strayed from collecting bronzes of the Koinon. Related silver and gold coins or medallions, however, occasionally appear. Another 
fascinating aspect of the Koinon bronzes is their relationship to the intriguing gold medallions from Aboukir and Tarsos. These medallions 
share many similarities with the bronzes -for instance a similar depiction of Alexander in his lionskin, and the otherwise unattested &quot;wind-
blown hair&quot; portrait; the lion hunt scene; and an interest in Olympias. Their general similarities and more precise iconographic details strongly 
support the argument that the gold medallions were also produced in Beroia. At one time it was believed that the bronzes imitated the gold 
medallions -the poor man&apos;s version of the deluxe object -but now the accepted view is that the bronzes preceded and influenced the medal-
lions. The theory that the gold medallions were produced as prize money is also no longer current. Prize money was normally given in spend-
able currency. The gold medallions are clearly not &quot;money&quot;. They vary in weight and in the fineness of the gold. The most likely explanation 
for their production is that they were commissioned by someone wealthy and important -perhaps the Makedoniarchos -to give as stunning 
gifts to high-status visitors to the games. 

For the collector, one of the most entertaining features of the bronze coinage of the Koinon is the vast range of reverse types and all the varia-
tion of combinations possible with the not inconsiderable breadth of obverse types. Within a relatively short space of time, I managed to as-
semble a good representative collection. My hope is that this collection will form the foundation on which someone else will be build further 
and that he or she will enjoy the pleasure of adding to it the exciting types that eluded me. I wish the new owner good luck!

Ex David Szapary-Donadello Collection. 

The Judgment of Paris, a mythical &quot;beauty contest&quot; of sorts, serves as a prelude to the Trojan War and thus is wholly appropriate for Ilium, a 
city believed to have been founded over Homeric Troy. Eris, goddess of discord, was excluded from a feast thrown by Zeus, but the scorned 
deity arrived uninvited with a golden apple inscribed &quot;for the fairest.&quot; Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite each claimed the apple, and Zeus was 
asked to award it to the most beautiful. Zeus, wishing to avoid this uncomfortable situation, appointed the mortal Paris as judge, as the 
shepherd and prince of Troy had a reputation for his fairness. Each goddess attempted to sway Paris with a bribe in order to win the apple: 
Athena offered him incredible skill in battle, Hera offered him an immense kingdom, and Aphrodite offered him the most beautiful woman in 
the world, Helen of Sparta, the wife of the Greek king Menelaus. Paris could not refuse Aphrodite&apos;s offer, setting in motion the war between

ΦAICTIΩNOC APX A T B, ΔAΛΔIAN/ΩN, Perseus advancing left, approaching the three Gorgon sisters (Stheno, Euryale, 
and Medusa) sleeping below a tree; winged Hypnos stands behind them; to upper left, Apollo Citharoedus within tetrastyle 
temple; to lower left, horse standing left, head right. RPC VII.1, 200 (A1/R1); Kraft pl. 45, 57 (same dies). Near EF, brown 
and green patina, very minor doubling. A beautifully composed and highly enigmatic mythological scene. Extremely rare and 
exceptional. 
($10,000) 

Four specimens are noted in RPC, all from the same dies as our massive medallion. This fifth example is the only one in private hands, the 
others being in Paris (RPC VII.1, pl. 17, 200), Berlin (two specimens, one of which is plated in Kraft), and Boston (NFA XII, lot 389). Our 
piece is the finest known, far superior to the published examples. 

Called the &quot;most-renowned of men&quot; by Homer, Perseus is best known today for his slaying of the Gorgon Medusa. The central scene 
depicts the Gorgones reclining below a tree, asleep, as the figure of Hypnos makes clear, while Perseus advances on them. The Gorgones are 
variously described in ancient accounts, but are often said to have had serpents for hair, golden wings, brass claws, and scale-like skin. The 
great tragedian Aeschylus tells us that they shared one eye, and it was during the shuffling of this organ that Perseus decided to strike, slaying 
Medusa, the only mortal of the three sisters. 

As noted in Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae (p. 347), however, the current scene is &quot;unusual and without known parallels.&quot; 
The temple of Apollo was a major religious center of Daldis. It is uncertain if the temple is merely included as a kind of civic badge, or if it 
reflects a local tradition that the events of the story occurred in the vicinity of Daldis (RPC p. 149), with this medallion possibly serving as an 
abbreviated copy of a well-known, though now lost, work of art at Daldis.

A highly interesting issue and one of only three examples known to Prieur at the time of his corpus (the specimen published by Bloesch is 
in the Winterthur Museum, the Kastner coin is now in the British Museum). As patron deity of Aegeae, which was renowned for its doctors, 
the appearance of Asclepius is not surprising, but the type must also allude to Caracalla&apos;s well being. The emperor&apos;s health had declined 
precipitously in the final years of his reign. On his way to campaign in the east in AD 214, he visited the great shrine of Asclepius at Pergamum 
in hopes of finding a cure. This visit was commemorated with a remarkable series of medallions issued at Pergamum, and around the same 
time Asclepius was honored on Caracalla&apos;s imperial coinage. The exact circumstances which led to this rare and artistic tetradrachm being 
struck at Aegeae are unknown. It is possible that Caracalla visited the important port town on his journey east. 

The legends can be translated as &quot;The Antonine city of Aegeae / of noble and Macedonian origin.&quot;

Uranius Antoninus is unknown from the ancient literary sources, although Zosimus perhaps confuses this figure with two usurpers during the 
reign of Severus Alexander, whom he names &quot;Uranius&quot; and &quot;Antoninus.&quot; Uranius established his government at Emesa, probably in response 
to repeated Persian attacks rather than as a challenge to Rome. In any event, it appears he was finally subdued when Valerian marched to 
recover the East.

Alexandria saw an immense output of coinage during the eighth year of Antoninus Pius&apos;s reign. The Zodiac drachms, mythological types, 
and a host of issues for the nomes appeared that year. One explanation for this activity centers on the celebration of the renewal of the Great 
Sothic cycle, the point when the star Sothis (Sirius) rises on the same point on the horizon as the sun. This cycle of 1461 years began early 
in the reign of Pius in AD 139, and apparently prompted a renewal in the ancient Egyptian religion, while the coin types also stressed the 
connections to the Greco-Roman Pantheon.

The revolt of Rome&apos;s Italian allies (socii, hence &apos;Social War&apos;) broke out toward the close of the year 91 BC and was the culmination 
of longstanding grievances occasioned by the Senate&apos;s inept handling of foreign relations. The Marsi were especially prominent in this 
movement, hence the name &apos;Marsic Confederation,&apos; which is often applied to the rebel state. The main fighting was in the years 90-89 BC 
and the rebellion assumed alarming proportions when both consuls for 90 BC were defeated by rebel armies. Rome appeared to be in serious 
danger of defeat, but the movement collapsed as suddenly as it had begun. The victory was probably achieved largely through the political 
concession of granting Roman citizenship to the enemy. Thereafter, all of Italy south of the Po was united by this common bond. The coinage 
of the Marsic Confederation is of great interest, consisting principally of silver denarii, some of which bear the names of the rebel generals. 
This exceptional specimen records a certain Gaius Paapius [Mutilus], consul of the rebel state and commander of the Samnite forces. Mutilus 
was defeated by Sulla in the later stages of the war and his subsequent history is uncertain, though it is possible that he survived to extreme 
old age when a wealthy man described as &quot;a leader of the Samnites during the Social War&quot; was proscribed by the Triumviral government in 
43 BC (cf. Appian, Civil Wars, iv. 25). The reverse depicts an oath-taking scene symbolizing the unity of the confederation of Italian states. 
Interestingly, the entire coin type is closely modeled on an issue of the moneyer Tiberius Veturius whose coinage is dated by Crawford (234/1) 
to circa 137 BC. Veturius&apos; reverse shows two soldiers taking the oath and is generally interpreted as referring to an agreement made with the 
Samnites in 321 BC (treaty of Caudium). This would have made it especially appropriate for an issue of the Samnite leader in the Social War.

This aureus, struck during the third consulship of the dictator Sulla in 80 BC, offers an intriguing glimpse of the Realpolitik of the Roman 
Republic in the early first century BC. The obverse depicts a purely Roman version of the goddess Roma, complete with the archaic Republican 
helmet decorated with a pair of plumes. The reverse features the statua Sullae, which was located near the Rostra in the Roman Forum, and 
which was dedicated by King Bocchus I of Mauretania to commemorate the role of Sulla (and Bocchus) in the capture of Jugurtha. It was the 
Jugurthine War (112-106 BC) that set in motion the subsequent period of internal political conflict between various generals and deep division 
within the Senate between the patricians and the novi homines, or &quot;new men,&quot; all of which culminated in the civil wars of the second half of 
the century and the establishment of the Principate under Augustus. 

The coin&apos;s moneyer, A. Manlius A. f., also participated in the Jugurthine War. In addition to serving as a legatus to the Roman commander-
in-chief, Gaius Marius (Sall. Iug. 86.1; 90.2; 102.23), he was appointed by Marius -along with Sulla -to meet with Bocchus, which resulted 
in the betrayal and capture of Jugurtha. Although his cognomen is unknown, Aulus Manlius was a member of the gens Manlia, one of the 
oldest and most patrician families of Rome. The gens boasted numerous holders of high office throughout the Republic, including a number 
of consuls. When the bloody civil war between Marius and Sulla broke out following the Social War (91-88 BC), Manlius allied himself with 
the conservative patricians who supported Sulla, rather than his old commander Marius, who was a novus homo. Nothing more is known 
of Manlius until 80 BC, when he struck this aureus. Why he did so remains the subject of speculation. A likely explanation is that the coin 
commemorates Sulla&apos;s resignation of the dictatorship he held the previous year. In keeping with his traditionalist sentiments, Sulla resigned 
his office (including disbanding his legions) and re-established consular government; he then dismissed his lictors and entered the Forum 
unprotected to give an account of himself to any citizen (Plut. Vit. Sull. 34). Thus, his action may have been viewed by his adherents (and 
certainly Manlius), as the victorious denouement of a great man who fought to preserve the values of the ancient Republic.

After his assassination of Julius Caesar, Brutus and Cassius occupied Rome, but had to flee when a funeral oration delivered by Caesar&apos;s 
protege, Mark Antony, turned public opinion against them. Brutus and Cassius went their separate ways, but met again in early 42 BC in 
Smyrna, Ionia, where they began preparations for the inevitable conflict that would ensue between them and Mark Antony and Octavian, 
Caesar&apos;s grandnephew. They began using their armies to conquer cities, for which this issue was undoubtedly struck. The title IMP on the 
reverse shows that Brutus still styled himself the savior of the Republic, as that was a title only the Senate can award, and the Victory breaking 
the royal symbols of diadem and scepter is a clear allusion to their anticipated victory over the forces of tyranny.

This was the first cistophorus minted in Asia in more than a decade and marked the beginning of a huge output of cistophori during the 
subsequent decade. Here, for the first time, Octavian is depicted as laureate, referring to Apollo and symbolizing his divinity. The obverse 
legend means &quot;Champion of the Liberty of the Roman People.&quot; The figure of Pax on the reverse tells of the peace which will surely result 
from Octavian&apos;s triumph over Rome&apos;s enemies. 

The significance of Apollo is emphasized by two changes in design from previous cistophori. The cista mystica, or snake basket, a common 
symbol in the cult of Dionysus that was prominently featured on the obverse of previous cistophori, is drastically reduced in size, and thus, 
less significant. Similarly, the reverse is no longer encircled by the Dionysiac garland of ivy, but by Apollo&apos;s laurel wreath.

The A.K. Collection of Roman Coinage 

The A.K. Collection of the coins of the Roman Empire was carefully assembled over several decades with a great deal of thought and 
commitment. The present selection consists of 755 silver and bronze pieces, mostly from the reigns of Commodus, Septimius Severus, 
Caracalla, Geta, Macrinus, and Diadumenian, and includes both Provincial and Imperial issues. There are also lots with a selection of 
Provincial coins and imitations of Hadrian to Antoninus Pius. The coins have been divided into the following 14 lots: seven lots contain only 
silver coins; two lots only contain bronzes; four lots containing only Provincial issues; two lots are from A.K.&apos;s collection of Alexandrian 
coins; and one lot of ancient imitations and fourrées, etc. of silver and bronze coins of Antoninus Pius to Geta. 

The quality of the coins ranges from Fine to Extremely fine. This interesting collection includes some very rare coins, as well as pieces from 
important collections like those of Dattari, Levis, Nägeli, Niggeler, Prince W(aldeck), Rosen, Steger, Stöcklin, and Voirol. In addition, most of 
the coins are provenanced from auctions or lists or were bought directly from stock such as those of J. Schulman, Amsterdam; Münzhandlung 
Basel; Münzen und Medaillen AG, Basel; Dr. Wruck and Habelt, Berlin; W. Winkel, Bielefeld; Frankfurter Münzhandlung E. Button, later 
Schweizerischer Bankverein, and B. Peus Frankfurt; H.P.R. Frey, Freiburg; Lanz, Graz; Rigö Münzenhandlung Konstanz; Naville, Geneva; 
Kurpfälzische Münzhandlung, Mannheim; Ars et Nummus, Milano; E. Beckenbauer, G. Hirsch, Münchner Münzhandlung K. Kress, and L.

Nicola, Rome; H.-W. Müller, Solingen; G. Neider, Stadtbergen; H.H. Kricheldorf, Stuttgart; G. Bernardi, Trieste; H.D. Rauch, Vienna; Bank 
Leu, and F. Sternberg, Zurich. 

A separate, fully illustrated catalogue of the complete collection has been compiled, containing the photos and full description of all 
the coins in each lot. This catalogue will be available during the Triton lot viewing at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York, but you 
may also request that a catalogue be sent to you. Additionally, this catalogue will be available online (see individual lots below for

In 17 BC, Augustus adopted the sons of Agrippa and Julia, Caius and Lucius, as his heirs. This coin commemorates Caius&apos; accompaniment of 
Tiberius on the latter&apos;s campain against the Germanic Sicambri. Although Caius was still only twelve years old at the time and must have had 
little to do with the actual affairs of the campaign, this issue depicts the explicitly-named &quot;son of Augusutus&quot; heroically charging into battle.

The reverse depicts the Parthian Arch. This coin solves an archaeological problem of the Arches in the Forum, where only one base has been 
found for the two arches built (the Actian and the Parthian). This denarius resolves the problem. The Parthian Arch was the Actian Arch. 
Builders added one smaller arcade on each side of the existing Actian Arch which is quite recognizable as the central arcade of the new arch, 
with the quadriga on its top. The two side arcades support Parthian archers. 

The transformation of the former Actian Arch may be explained by three factors. There was significant economy in just adding to the existing 
arch. Space in the Forum was limited. The Actian Arch hadn&apos;t been welcomed or appreciated by the people of Rome. The &quot;official&quot; version 
behind Actium had been the declaration of war on Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt. This had not fooled the well-informed citizens and inhabitants 
of Rome, who knew that Mark Antony had been the actual enemy defeated. A triumphal arch celebrating a victory over other Roman citizens 
must have seemed inappropriate. Augustus seized the opportunity of making the controversial celebration of Actium disappear inside a 
consensual Parthian victory triple Arch.

The denarius of Tiberius with Pax reverse, is commonly known as the &apos;Tribute Penny,&apos; the coin to which Jesus referred to when he was 
discussing the payment of taxes to the Romans: &quot;render to Caesar the things that are Caesar&apos;s, and to God the things that are God&apos;s&quot; (Mark 
12:17). Although there are two other reverse types on the denarii of Tiberius, those were only issued during the first two years of his reign, 
while the Pax reverse was employed throughout the remainder, making it the more likely coin referred to by Jesus. It was also the most 
common imperial-issue coin circulating in the region at the time. The term &apos;penny&apos; is from the 1611 King James translation of the Bible, and 
was adopted since the penny was the standard denomination of the time.

Wilkinson and Hodge in 1885 and 1893, ostensibly so that he could concentrate on the Greek series. The sale catalog of his Roman coins, in

Beginning during the latter imperatorial period during the campaigns of Julius Caesar, Roman interest and influence in Britan grew throughout 
the next three centuries. Many emperors were personally involved in campaigns, which were often commemorated on their respective coinages. 

During the reign of Claudius, Verica, king of the Atrebates and ally of Rome, was forced into exile by invasions of the Catuvellauni, a 
neighboring tribe to the east. This served as the pretense for Claudius&apos; invasion of Britan in AD 43, led by the general Aulus Plautius, who 
subsequently served as governor of the region (the future emperor Vespasian also ranked among the commanders). While Claudius had some 
participation in the campaigns -bringing reinforcements and elephants to Camulodunum -and received a triumph after his return to Rome, 
he refused the title Britannicus. The success of these invasions was commemorated on various issues. One, an issue of aurei, depicts the two 
triumphal arches erected by the Roman Senate -one in Gaul and the other in Rome -in honor of these momentous victories. So momentous 
was the successful establishment of Roman rule in Britain that Claudius celebrated it even on a provincial issue from the far eastern mint in 
Cappadocia.

While Julius Caesar recognized the value of expanding Rome&apos;s port facilities at Ostia, it was Claudius who began actual building in AD 42. 
As part of the construction, one of Caligula&apos;s pleasure galleys was scuttled and filled with cement; above it was constructed a lighthouse 
surmounted by a statue of Neptune. Although the actual date of completion is not certain, it must have occurred shortly before this sestertius 
was minted. A further expansion of the facilities was required under Trajan and Hadrian. By the fourth century, however, the port&apos;s importance 
began to diminish as a result of silting. Soon the region became a breeding ground for malaria and was abandoned.

This reverse type commemorates the protection of Nero from the Pisonian Conspiracy. Events of the years AD 64-65 defined the subsequent 
reputation of Nero as a cruel and self-indulgent ruler. His &quot;excesses&quot; resulted in a conspiracy to overthrow and replace him with Gaius 
Calpurnius Piso. Among the conspirators were many high-ranking members of Nero&apos;s court, including Seneca the Younger, the poet Lucan, 
and Petronius (Nero&apos;s self-proclaimed &quot;arbiter of elegance&quot;). To Nero, the failure of a conspiracy made up of those so close to him could have 
been achieved only through divine intervention. As the king of the Gods oversaw the security of the Roman state, Nero believed it was Jupiter 
the Guardian (Custos) who had saved him from harm.

The Temple of Janus was one of Rome&apos;s most ancient centers of worship. It was said that Romulus had built it after he made peace with the 
Sabines, and that it was king Numa who decreed that its doors should be opened during times of war and shut during times of peace. In all of 
Roman history until the reign of Nero, the temple doors had been shut perhaps five or six times -once under king Numa, once at the end of 
the Second Punic War, three times under Augustus, and, according to Ovid, once under Tiberius. 

With the close of the Parthian War in AD 63 it was decreed that the doors should again be closed. Nero marked the event with great 
celebrations and trumpeted his policy of peace by issuing a large and impressive series of coins. The inscription on this issue announces &quot;the 
doors of Janus have been closed after peace has been procured for the Roman People on the land and on the sea.&quot; The doors of the temple 
probably remained closed for less than a year, being opened again with the onset of strife in Judaea in 66.

The Great Fire of Rome in AD 64 -that, which according to tradition, Nero is said to have intentionally set -destroyed huge portions of the 
city, with many of Rome&apos;s most important and sacred buildings being casualties of the disaster. The temple of Vesta must have been among 
the first to have been rebuilt, as the venerated flame it enclosed was closely tied to Rome&apos;s fortunes.

The main Judaea Capta coinage was a series of imperial issues struck in gold, silver, and bronze, and provincial issues struck in silver and 
bronze, to celebrate the Roman defeat of Judaea, the capture of Jerusalem, and the destruction of the Jewish Second Temple during the First 
Jewish War (66-73 CE). Generally, the reverse of this coinage shows a Jewish female seated in an attitude of mourning beneath a palm 
tree. Sometimes a bound male captive, or the figure of the victorious emperor or Victory, is found standing on the other side amid weapons, 
shields, and helmets. While some gold and silver coins bear no legend on the reverse, most issues are inscribed IVDAEA CAPTA, IVDAEA 
DEVICTA, or simply IVDAEA. The imperial coins were struck for only Vespasian and Titus. Provincial drachms were minted in Asia Minor 
for Titus (who oversaw the capture of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Temple). The provincial bronze coinage for Titus and Domitian 
(who did not participate in any of the actions, but was included by familial association) was struck in Judaea by the Roman administration at 
Caesarea Maritima and even by the Romanized Jewish ruler, Agrippa II, who was a friend of Titus and his supporter during the war.

Very Rare Depiction of Pax 
Rome Celebrates Judaean Victory

This most unorthodox representation of Pax belongs to the large and important series of aes issued in AD 71, the year that witnessed the 
joint triumph of Vespasian and Titus through the streets of Rome in celebration of their victory in Judaea. At this time, the Roman Empire 
had experienced five straight years of warfare, which had devastated the economy and threatened the very foundations of the empire. The 
goddess of peace here holds a flaming torch with which she sets fire to a heap of arms, the spoils of Rome&apos;s defeated enemies. This symbolic 
act was carried out in fulfillment of a vow undertaken to Rome&apos;s principal deities of war, Mars and Minerva. A statue of the latter appears atop 
a column accompanying the scene of celebration. The hope was that with the cessation of hostilities, the Roman people could now enjoy a 
period of tranquility under Flavian rule.

The reverse is believed by some to represent the bronze heifer created by the 5th century BC Athenian sculptor Myron. Vespasian placed the 
monumental work in his Templum Pacis (Temple of Peace), which was constructed following the close of the Jewish War. The temple complex 
doubled as a sort of public museum, where many of the spoils from the sack of Jerusalem were displayed alongside prominent works of art.

This important tessera belongs to the series originating in city of Rome and her outlying suburbs. Beginning with some types related to the late 
Julio-Claudian dynasty and continuing perhaps as late as the mid-3rd century, these leads are readily distinguished from those found elsewhere 
in the Empire on the basis of their cast manufacture. The types present a dizzying variety, ranging from official-seeming triumphal and 
Imperial portraits to an array of local and foreign deities, games-related images, and other scenes. In general, the images used on the tesserae 
do not copy coins, with the present example a notable exception. The function of these leads remains poorly understood, with suggested uses 
including entrance tickets, grain distribution tokens, and small denomination currency. This cataloger prefers the later interpretation, and 
would contend that, as such a wide variety of types share such similar physical characteristics, attempting to interpret their role based solely 
on their imagery is unwise, and any function must take into account all pieces of the same fabric. 

Only a handful of the more than 2000 types known for this series of tesserae can be tied to the Judaea Capta issues. These include two bearing 
a portrait of Vespasian on the obverse and a palm tree on the reverse, one with the legend IVDE and a palm, and one with Victory inscribing a 
shield set on a palm and palm tree with T L flanking, as well as the present type (M. &amp; B. Overbeck, &quot;Romische Bleimarken als Zeugnis des 
Ersten Jüdischen Krieges,&quot; in Helas und der Grechen Osten, pl. 9, 17-24). Additional Flavian portrait or triumphal types may be related as 
well, but cannot be confirmed. The identification of the palm tree on these pieces as emblematic of the Judaea Capta triumph is evident, and 
the Victory obverse on the present example has numerous parallels in the official coinage (Rome: RIC II 217-8; Roman Judaea: Hendin 1445; 
Herodian Judaea: 1285; Pella: Spijkerman 3). The reverse type -a flamen&apos;s apex -has no clear parallels, though the hat does appear among 
other objects on the reverse of Julius Caesar&apos;s famous elephant denarii (see Crawford 443/1). Considering the types and possible functions, it 
is tempting to imagine this piece being thrown to the adoring crowds along the route of Vespasian&apos;s triumph, as relics captured from Jerusalem 
parade past.

While no decisive evidence exists for the location of the mint of the cistophori during the reigns of Vespasian through Trajan, the style, 
legends, and, in particular, the consistent die axis point to Rome, suggesting that these coins were minted in the capital and then sent to Asia

In AD 103 or 104, the Roman Senate declared Trajan &quot;Optimus Princeps&quot;-the best emperor -linking the beloved temporal ruler with the 
principal deity and protector of the Roman state, Jupiter Optimus Maximus (&quot;the Best and Greatest&quot;). 

J.P. Morgan purchased many of the finest coins offered in the important Strozzi sale. The wealthy Florentine Strozzi inherited a portion of his 
collection and, as Commissioner of Antiquities for Tuscany, had ample opportunities to add to it, carefully selecting specimens from many of 
the most important Italian hoards of the time.

From the Kallman Collection. Ex Classical Numismatic Group 85 (15 September 2010), lot 887. 

The bridge on the reverse of this coin has been generally thought to be that constructed across the Danube by Trajan&apos;s architect, Apollodorus 
of Damascus, in AD 104. There is good circumstantial evidence for this. The date range for this coin&apos;s issue is closely contemporary with the 
date of the bridge&apos;s construction and would fit in well programmatically with those war-related issues of the same time frame.

Parthian interference in Armenia prompted Trajan to declare war against their king, Osroes I, in AD 114. He quickly re-established Roman 
control of Armenia, forced the submission of Osrhoene, and in AD 116 took Mesopotamia by defeating Osroes I. Rather than pursuing the 
Parthians into Iran, Trajan set up a pro-Roman Parthian &quot;buffer state&quot; in Mesopotamia under a puppet-king appointed by Trajan, Parthamasiris. 
This event is commemorated on this issue.

It is a great misfortune that Rome&apos;s most philosophically-minded emperor spent much of his reign preoccupied with the practical affairs of 
waging war. The Parthian War (AD 161-166) demanded that many troops stationed in the northern provinces be moved east. The Marcomanni, 
Quadi, and Sarmatiae all quickly capitalized on the decreased military presence and swarmed southward, even posing a threat to Italy. 
Marcus took personal command in AD 167 and managed to establish peace through a series of hard-fought victories, which this scarce issue 
commemorates. It was during these campaigns that Marcus began writing his famous philosophical work, Meditations.

Ex Gemini VI (10 January 2010), lot 454. 

This remarkable obverse has been the cause of debate. The pelta, a distinctively Amazonian shield, has long led some to identify the female 
figure as Marcia, Commodus&apos; concubine and trusted companion whom, we are told, the emperor loved to see dressed as an Amazon (SHA, 
Commodus 12.1). The idea that Marcia -who was involved in the assassination of Commodus -should appear on a medallion of the emperor 
struck the year of his death has incredible historical and emotional appeal, and prominent 20th century scholars like Harold Mattingly and 
Jocelyn Toynbee accepted the identification. Others have discounted this fantastic claim, questioning the likelihood of a mistress with no 
official role or titles making an appearance on medallions. 

Dressel has argued that the pelta could be an attribute of Commodus rather than the female figure. &quot;Amazonius&quot; was one of the many titles 
the crazed emperor bestowed on himself late in his reign (when Commodus renamed the months of the year, March became &quot;Amazonius&quot;). A 
similar obverse type also from AD 192 has jugate busts of Commodus and a female figure wearing a helmet and cuirass, normally identified 
as Minerva. It is possible that the current obverse depicts Roma, as there is some evidence that Roma and Minerva were favored deities of 
the emperor.

This heretofore unpublished and very important aureus is a new type (Legion XXII) to be included with the four previously recorded gold 
types in the extensive &apos;legionary&apos; series issued by Severus at the very outset of his reign. According to Dio Cassius (XLVI, 46, 7), Severus 
paid an accession donative of 250 denarii (ten aurei) per man, and in all likelihood the legionary coinage was specially struck for this purpose. 
Legio XXII Primigenia was one of the legions to receive special honors from the new emperor as it supported his bid for the purple. Founded 
in AD 39 by Gaius (Caligula) as part of his campaigns in Germania, the XXII Primigenia spent much of their time in Mogontiacum (modern 
Mainz) up to the end of 3rd century.

All of Septimius&apos; Victory types from 209 to 211 must refer to the campaign against the Caledonians of Britain, even when it is not explicitly 
stated. It would be the emperor&apos;s last campaign, as he fell ill and died at his headquarters in York in February of 211. Caracalla took command 
of the forces following Severus&apos; death and made peace with the Caledonians on less-than-favorable terms. The Romans were required to 
retreat to Hadrian&apos;s Wall. 

The references above describe the diminutive figure being led by Victory as either a captive (RIC, BMCRE) or child (Calicó).

While gladitorial combat is the sport that most people today would associate with ancient Rome, chariot races held at tracks, or circuses, 
were the real passion of the populace. The Circus Maximus (&quot;largest&quot; or &quot;greatest circus&quot;) lived up to its grand name, with modern scholars 
estimating that the building could hold some 150,000 spectators, or roughly three times the number of people that the Colosseum could 
accommodate (Pliny&apos;s statement that the Circus could hold 250,000 appears to be an exaggeration). Caracalla renovated the Circus in AD 213, 
and rare aurei and sestertii were issued to celebrate the project. 

This artistic aerial view depicts the Circus as it would be seen from the Palatine Hill. According to Pliny, the Circus was established during 
the reign of the Tarquinius Priscus, Etruscan king of Rome (circa 616-579 BC), although a permanent structure may not have existed until 
329 BC, when the starting gates (carceres) were erected. By the early 2nd century AD, the structure was very close to the form that we see on 
our coin. In the center of the Circus we find the spina (&quot;spine&quot;), upon which is the obelisk of the Pharaoh Ramesses the Great that Augustus 
brought to Rome and erected in the Circus (it is located today in Rome&apos;s Piazza del Popolo). At each end of the spina is a meta, or conical 
column situated where the charioteers would make their harrowing turns, while an equestrian statue of Trajan and a shrine of Cybele can be 
found immediately to the left and right of the obelisk, respectively. 

In the foreground and to right are arcades and a prominent arched gate, while on the left we find the semicircular end of the structure, with the 
attic statuary of a triumphal arch of Titus visible. The temple of Sol and Luna, built into the seating, is visible on the far end of the structure, 
to the left of the obelisk&apos;s peak. 

The coin cited in RIC and BMCRE was in Baldwin&apos;s stock in 1927. The example plated in Calicó, with which our coin shares the same reverse 
die, was sold by Freeman &amp; Sear in 2005 (FPL 10, no. 111), while another specimen was recently sold by Künker (Auction 270, lot 8855). Our 
coin may be only the third or fourth known, depending on whether or not the 1927 Baldwin&apos;s piece is distinct from the other known examples.

The dating of the memorial issues of Caracalla are problematic. It would have made a great deal of political sense for Elagabalus to have 
issued them, as the Syrian prince&apos;s claim to legitimacy was that he was the son of Caracalla and thus rightful heir to the throne (not to mention 
the great restorer of the Severan dynasty following Macrinus&apos; usurpation). RIC p. 128, note 720, concedes that they could date to the reign of 
Elagabalus, but places them under Severus Alexander as the obverse legend names Caracalla &quot;the Great.&quot; This epithet was linked, of course, 
to Alexander the Great, and RIC comments that its use on the Divus Caracalla coins provides a &quot;definite allusion&quot; to the Macedonian king&apos;s 
namesake, Severus Alexander.

At the age of fourteen, Varius Avitus Bassianus (better known as Elagabalus or Heliogabalus) inherited the office of high priest of the sun god 
El-Gabal at Emesa in Syria. The deity was worshipped in the form of a sacred stone, and when Elagabalus was made emperor and journeyed 
from Emesa to Rome, he took the stone, probably a meteorite, with him. During his reign, the emperor was devoted to promoting the cult of 
El-Gabal, building a lavish temple on the Palatine Hill to house the stone. For a brief period, the exotic eastern deity nearly came to dominate 
the Roman Pantheon. 

While this issue could possibly commemorate the journey from Emesa to Rome, it more likely refers to the annual transfer of the stone from 
its principal temple in Rome to its &quot;summer home,&quot; a large and richly decorated temple in the suburbs. Describing the transfer, Herodian 
(V.6.7) writes: 

A six-horse chariot bore the sun god, the horses huge and flawlessly white, with expensive gold fittings and rich ornaments. No one held the 
reins, and no one rode in the chariot; the vehicle was escorted as if the sun god himself were the charioteer. Heliogabalus ran backward in 
front of the chariot, facing the god and holding the horses&apos; reins. He made the whole journey in this reverse fashion, looking up into the face 
of his god.

quadriga, see NAC 29, lot 596 = De Arrizabalaga y Prado p. 103, fig. 67.

In March AD 222, Elagabalus was murdered by members of the Praetorian Guard whom had clearly begun to favor the emperor&apos;s thirteen

must have been among his first public acts as new emperor. This is commemorated by coins struck in gold, silver, and bronze carrying 
Liberalitas (liberality, generosity) either by herself or alongside the emperor in a distribution scene.

Due to the precarious situation within the Empire at the time, the Roman army in Gaul declared their general, Postumus, emperor after he led 
their successful defeat of the Iuthungi in AD 260. By the end of the following year, Postumus was also recognized in the provinces of Raetia, 
Upper and Lower Germany, Britain, and Spain. From the very beginning of his usurpation, it appears that Postumus&apos; attention focused solely 
on the territories he had already acquired, and not on a bid to overthrow Gallienus. Consequently, the administration of his empire closely 
paralleled that of Rome, and Postumus adopted the title of Pontifex Maximus, as well as assumed the consulship and tribunician power each 
year. These actions led some scholars to conclude that Postumus was attempting to position himself to achieve recognition from Gallienus as a 
sort of co-emperor. In AD 265, Gallienus finally attempted to dislodge Postumus from power, but was unsuccessful, thus allowing the usurper 
to continue to rule his Gallic empire until he was assassinated by disaffected troops in AD 269.

RIC places this same type at Ticinum, Cyzicus, and Antioch. The style clearly debunks any attribution to a mint as far west as Ticinum. 
Although Pink prefers Antioch for this issue, he does note that these aurei are &quot;in the style of Cyzicus.&quot; M. Weder, in his analysis of the eastern 
issues of Probus (NC 1984, pp. 202-213), questions Pink&apos;s attribution and argues for a possible allocation of them to Cyzicus (pp. 202-203).

Like many Roman emperors of his time, the Illyrian Severus II gained power and influence by climbing the ranks of the army. In May AD 
305, he was made the western Caesar, overseeing his territory from his capital at Milan. Galerius promoted him to co-Augustus on the death 
of Constantius I Chlorus the following year, and Constantius&apos; son Constantine I was appointed as the new Caesar. This must not have sat well 
with Maxentius, son of the former Augustus Maximianus, who was overlooked as a potential successor to his own father. Maxentius revolted 
in late 306 and Severus II led his army south to Rome in early 307 in order to put an end to it. A large number of Severus&apos; troops had previously 
served under Maximianus, however, and felt more loyalty to their prior commander and his son than to the current Augustus. Many of Severus&apos; 
soldiers joined Maxentius army, leaving Severus with no choice but to surrender. Although promised his life would be spared if he surrendered 
peacefully, Severus was killed in September of 307.

During his war with Constantine, Licinius appointed his magister officiorum, Martinian, as his co-emperor. The new Augustus was then 
deployed to Lampsacus to oppose Constantine&apos;s army as it crossed the Hellespont. After his defeat, Martinian was imprisoned in Cappadocia, 
where he was later executed on Constantine&apos;s orders. During his brief reign, Martinian struck coinage at two mints, Cyzicus and Nicomedia.

The coinage of Constantine&apos;s long reign is very complex. He instituted several important currency reforms, including the introduction of a 
new gold denomination (the solidus) and, later in the reign, the reestablishment of coinage in pure silver (e.g. siliqua). This rare dynastic 
type, struck at the Danubian mint of Sirmium, depicts on the reverse the emperor&apos;s two elder sons -Flavius Julius Crispus, the issue of his 
marriage to Minervina (his first wife or, perhaps, merely a concubine); and Flavius Claudius Constantinus, the eldest of his three sons by 
Flavia Maxima Fausta, daughter of the emperor Maximianus. The head of Crispus, who was aged about twenty-one at the time of the issue, 
is depicted larger and more mature than that of his half-brother who was only eight. This base silver coin, which is sometimes described as a 
&apos;small medallion&apos; or a &apos;multiple,&apos; is of an experimental denomination, which preceded the reintroduction of pure silver coinage circa AD 325. 
It should probably be called a miliarensis, which is the name applied to the pure silver coin of the same weight (4.5 grams = 1/72 of a pound) 
struck regularly after AD 325.

Struck early in Constantine II&apos;s reign, this rare solidus uses a reverse type of his father&apos;s. At the time of his death, Constantine I had recently 
celebrated thirty years as emperor, and Constantine II twenty years as Caesar. The elder Constantine had also successfully reconquered Dacia 
by 336, a province that was relinquished under Aurelian sixty years before.

A fascinating contorniate depicting the ancient Greek historian Herodotus. The bust of Herodotus is almost identical to that used for the Greek 
philosopher Socrates (see Alföldi 84 [pl. 27, 10]). The reverse type is from a die used for the Roman playwright Terence (Publius Terentius 
Afer). This contorniate is one of just a few known depictions of Herodotus on an ancient coin or medal.

Maximus was the domesticus (household manager) and probably a relative of the general Gerontius, who revolted against Constantine III in 
AD 409. Basically a non-entity and Gerontius&apos; puppet, Maximus was allowed to retire into private life when his master committed suicide in 
AD 411. However, if this Maximus is the same person as the Maximus tyrannus who unsuccessfully attempted to seize power in Spain around 
AD 420, his good fortune did not last. Maximus tyrannus was captured and publicly executed at the games celebrating Honorius&apos; tricennalia 
at Ravenna in AD 422 as an example for any other would-be traitors. According to Philip Grierson (DOCLR, p. 219), there are about twenty 
known coins of Maximus.

Verina had an extraordinary personal history, plotting from time to time for and against her various relatives in numerous intrigues to control 
the succession or seize the throne. The very rare gold coinage in her name is attributed to two separate periods, an earlier issue struck in 
462 or 466 and a later issue in 471 or 473. The present coin, from the later issue, comes in the final years of Leo I&apos;s reign, when Verina was 
instrumental in arranging the elevation of the couple&apos;s young grandson Leo II. Commenting on this issue, Kent notes that &quot;in contrast to her 
earlier coinage, she is shown with hunched and forbidding features&quot;. Perhaps the stress of palace intrigue was already taking its toll on the 
empress.

After the assassination of Valentinian III, the western Roman empire endured 20 years of chaos under a succession of ephemeral emperors, 
usurpers and puppet rulers. Nominally the appointee and co-ruler with the emperor at Constantinople, the Roman emperors were in fact at the 
mercy of the Germans, Goths and Huns who, as magistri militum, or Masters of Soldiers, held the true reins of power. Emperors were deposed 
at will; Petronius Maximus in 455, Avitus the following year, Majorian in 461, Libius Severus in 465, Anthemius in 472, Olybrius the same 
year, and Glycerius in 474. Only Majorian and Anthemius had the blessings of the monarch of the east. Glycerius, although a moderately 
successful ruler, was replaced by Julius Nepos, the nephew of Leo I, and ordained bishop of Salona. Nepos was unable to restore order in 
Italy, and Leo&apos;s death later in 474 left him in an exposed position. The magister militum Orestes elevated his own son Romulus (Augustulus) 
to the purple, and Nepos fled Ravenna, his last outpost in Italy, and into exile in Dalmatia. The presumptive emperor came to know intense 
frustration when, in 476, Orestes and Romulus were overthrown by Odoacer, who declared the western kingdom no longer required a separate 
emperor. Nepos&apos;s entreaties for his restoration were ignored, although Zeno expressed his sympathy, and urged Odaocer to allow him to return 
to Ravenna. In fact, the true last &quot;Roman&quot; emperor lived in exile until 480, when he was murdered, supposedly on the orders of the bishop of 
Salona, the same Glycerius who had been deposed by Nepos in 474.

BYZANTINE COINAGE 

The Goldman Collection of Anastasius I through Justinian I 

CNG is proud to offer the Goldman Collection of coins of the early Byzantine Empire. This specialized collection focuses on the first three 
Byzantine emperors -Anastasius I, Justin I, and Justinian I -and includes multiple officinae for most types. Each coin has been carefully 
selected by the collector and acquired in exceptional condition whenever possible. 

To name just a few of the highlights, the Goldman Collection features eight joint-reign solidi of Justin I and Justinian (lots 994-1001), an issue 
that was only struck for a four month period. Collectors of provincial mint issues will have much to choose from, including several wonderful 
Thessalonican solidi of Justinian (lots 1038-1040), an exceptionally rare and only recently discovered Alexandrian solidus (lot 1043), and a 
number of rare and important Italic issues (1049, 1051-1053, to give just a few examples). While the collection focuses primarily on the gold 
coinage, collectors of silver issues will also find a small number of coins that suit their interest.

There is some disagreement as to whether this issue belongs to Rome or Ravenna. Hahn reattributed the Paris specimen published by Morrisson 
(with which our coin shares a reverse die) from Ravenna to Rome, but more recently Ranieri included it in his corpus of the Ravenna mint. 
Our coin is stylistically close to the specimens attributed to Rome in DOC and MIBE (see especially 34 2-3 ).

It was not unusual for the Rome mint engravers to abbreviate the normal &quot;AVG&quot; in the obverse legend to &quot;AG.&quot; This particular variant with 
simply the &quot;G&quot; is not noted in the standard references and is possibly unique to this obverse die. See MIBE 34 6 for a similar obverse style.

Hahn (MIBE) assigns only the solidi with terminal letters A, Γ and S to Ravenna and interprets them as dates rather than officinae, although 
admits (p. 50) that this is somewhat problematic (he suggests this date could correspond to 562/3). 

The Monte Judica Hoard was discovered sometime around 1981 on Monte Judica in the province of Catania, Sicily. The hoard is highly 
important for the light it shines on the production of Sicilian gold under Justinian I and Justin II.

small &quot;Z.&quot; Hahn moved this issue from Ravenna (MIB) to a mint in Sicily (MIBE) based on the Monte Judica Hoard (see previous lot). He 
interprets the terminal letters of the reverse legends to be dates rather than officinae, with year 7 corresponding to 557/8.

Beginning in 608, the exarch of Africa and his son, both named Heraclius, began issuing coinage in opposition to that of the unpopular 
Byzantine emperor Phocas. This coinage named and depicted the Heraclii as consuls (though neither held the title at that time) rather than 
as emperors, a political move that promoted the Heraclii as champions of the people, not merely rivals to the throne. The revolt culminated 
with Heraclius the younger&apos;s coup at Constantinople, where he was welcomed by the population, crowned, and saw to the execution of his 
predecessor in 610.

ISLAMIC, Umayyad Caliphate. temp. Mu&apos;awiya I ibn Abi Sufyan. AH 41-60 / AD 661-680. AV Solidus (20mm, 
4.42 g, 6h). Pseudo-Byzantine type. Three crowned figures (Heraclonas, Heraclius, and Heraclius Constantine) standing 
facing, each holding globus cruciger with crossbar removed / uiCTOri∂ ∂ugK b, cross potent with crossbar removed set on 
three steps; i ß across field; CONOB. Miles, Earliest 4 and pl. XLV, 8 = Walker, Arab-Byzantine 54 = BM Inv. 1904,0511.320; 
Album 3548; ICV 121; cf. Morton &amp; Eden 63, lot 7 (for rev.). VF, some light toning, traces of deposits, areas of flat strike at 
periphery, evidence of possible prior mounting. One of four known and the first to appear at auction. 
($20,000) 

The earliest, and still best discussion, of the early pre-reform Islamic gold coinage is that of Miles. There, he records four, based on 
contemporary Byzantine prototypes:one featuring the emperor Phocas; a second with Heraclius and his son Heraclius Constantine; a third 
of the later Heraclius and Heraclius Constantine type; and, lastly, the issue with Heraclius flanked by his sons, Heraclius Constantine and 
Heraclonas. Our coin is an example of that last type. On the reverse, the cross potent has been altered in order to &quot;dechristianize&quot; the cross, 
in keeping with the Islamic prohibition against graven images. In addition, the letters I and B appear across the field. To date, our coin is the 
only other example of this type known with the additional letters I and B. One example, however, of this type, but with the additional letters 
I and A is known (see One hundred coins of the great dynasties of Islam [privately printed]), as well as one with an addition letter I and the 
Heraclian monogram (NGSA VIII, lot 226). When taken together with Miles&apos; other types, which have similar numbers on the reverse (see 
Album 23, lot 68 and Morton &amp; Eden 63, lot 7), the multiple letters -I, IA, IB (and, possibly, an IΓ) -supports the suggestion that these 
numbers may represent the caliphal year of Mu&apos;awiya, during whose reign these coins were struck. Since the Byzantine prototypes were 
already circulating widely within the former eastern territories of the Byzantines now held by the Umayyads, it naturally followed that the 
Muslims would strike similar types, but with certain specific modifications -namely, the appearance of the Christian Cross. According to the 
Maronite Chronicle (AG 970 (AD 660]), however, this coinage was not accepted by the presumably Christian members of the population, 
&quot;because there was no cross on it.&quot; 

On at least two occasions, however, Mu&apos;awiya was required to pay tribute to the Byzantines, and it is possible that these coins were struck 
specifically for that purpose. One was in AD 659, when the payment supposedly amounted to a thousand nomismata. The second was in 
AD 678, when Mu&apos;awiya was forced to agree to a very harsh treaty that obliged him to make an annual payment to the Byzantine emperor 
of three thousand nomismata. Since these coins would have gone to Constantinople to fulfill the required payment, and there subsequently 
melted down to be restruck later (in addition to the reported rejection of these coins among the Christian members of the local population), the 
extreme rarity of these coins today can be accounted for easily. This conclusion may be supported by their iconography. The originals of all 
four types cited by Miles would have circulated widely in Syria, which depended on Byzantine gold and copper coinage -both in great supply 
-to support their monetary needs for both large transactions and everyday purchases. The originals of the first three types were undoubtedly 
well known to the inhabitants of Syria and, with only minor alterations in their design, Mu&apos;awiya could expect them to be accepted in 
circulation without difficulty. In its original form, however, the fourth type, with its Christian and imperial iconography, would have been 
familiar to the general public as a direct and potent symbol of Byzantine power. By removing the specifically Christian iconography from 
the design, the three imperial figures could appear as tribute bearers bringing their gifts, such as the three wise men, who were well known to 
both Christians and Muslims. 

This extremely rare piece may be regarded as one of the earliest Islamic gold issues.

Iconic Rarity of the Umayyad Caliphate 

1138. 
ISLAMIC, Umayyad Caliphate. temp. &apos;Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan. AH 65-86 / AD 685-705. AV Dinar (21mm, 
4.25 g, 6h). Unnamed (Dimashq [Damascus]?) mint. Dated AH 77 (AD 696/7). First portion of the kalimat at-tawḥīd: lā ilāha 
illā-llāhu waḥdahu lā sharīka lahu (there is no god except Allah, and one [is] he; (there is) no partner to him) in three lines; 
in outer margin, the &quot;Umayyad Second Symbol&quot; (Sura 9 [al-tauba]:33): muḥammadur rasūlu-llāh arsalahu bi-&apos;lhudā wa 
dīn al-haqq lī-yuzhirahu &apos;ala al-dīn kollihi walau kariha al-mushrikūn (Muhammad is the messenger of Allah; him He sent 
with guidance and true faith to make it prevail over all other faiths even though the polytheists may hate it) / The &quot;Umayyad 
Symbol&quot; (Sura 112 [al-ikhlas]) Āllah ahad Āllah āl-samad lam yalīd wa lam yalūd (Allah [is] One; Allah [is] the Eternal, 
the Absolute; not begetting and not begotten) in three lines; in outer margin, b-ismi-llāh zarb hazā āl-dinār fī sanat seb&apos; wa 
seb&apos;īn (in the name of Allah struck this dinar in the year seven and seventy (after the Hijra)). AGC I 41; SICA 2, 1 (same dies); 
Walker, Arab-Byzantine, 186; Album 125; ICV 155. EF, hint of double strike, minor scratches in lower field of reverse. Very 
rare and the key date in the series. 
($200,000) 

This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a superb example of the Umayyad dinar struck in the year 77 of the Hijra. This iconic coin was 
the first of its kind to describe the tenets of the Islamic Faith rather than being issued on behalf of a political dynasty. It exercised an influence 
far beyond the borders of the Islamic Empire for over a thousand years. It drew a clear line between the coinage of the former rulers of the 
Levant, who were the Trinitarian Byzantines, and the monophysite Arabs. Its texts perfectly encapsulated the new Faith of Islam. The obverse 
field states the unique nature of God, and in the margin that Muhammad, as the messenger of God, was responsible for the spread of this belief. 
The field legend on the reverse expands on this by ruling out the incarnation of Christ as the Son of God. The margin emphasizes that the 
coin was struck in the name of God, rather than the Umayyad ruler, and shows the date of its striking in the new Hijra era. Thus, the legends 
encapsulated a vigorous response to the Byzantine gold solidus of Justinian II where an image of Christ was placed on the obverse and that 
of the Emperor grasping a cross on the reverse. 

History does not record the exact date at which the Caliph &apos;Abd al-Malik bin Marwan introduced his new coinage, but because of the rarity of 
this issue the cataloguer suggests that it was probably towards the end of the year 77, perhaps for the pilgrimage season at the time of the &apos;Eid 
al-Adha. All those who held examples of this coin in their hands, and the annual issues which followed after it, carried with them a powerful 
missionary document, which explained all that was necessary for a follower of the Faith to accept. In an age before modern communications, 
coinage was the most effective messenger that the government possessed to sway the hearts and minds of the people under its rule.

The region of Ensisheim, known as Alsace in French, was a territory within the Holy Roman Empire. The landgravate was held by the 
Hapsburg dynasty until 1639, when much of the region was conquered by France. It was then administered by France until 1871, when the 
region was incorporated into Germany following the Franco-Prussian War. Alsace was again returned to France in 1919, following the First 
World War. Though we generally catalog city coins under the modern-day country, considering the political complexities of the region, we 
have decided to place this series under Austria, to recognize Ensisheim&apos;s place in Vorderösterreich (Further Austria).

This coin is struck from official dies taken from the English mint of York, muling the Crux type of AEthelred II on the obverse and on the 
reverse AEthelred&apos;s Intermediate Small Cross type by the York moneyer Arnketill. Malmer&apos;s die study of the Anglo-Scandinavian coinage 
solidified the view that three geographic groups exist, correlating generally to the medieval kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. 
These dies are extensively linked to a chain that falls in the &apos;southern&apos; group. It is thought that the coins of this group were likely struck in the 
Danish kingdom at the mint of Lund, with some possibly belonging to Sigtuna. Although these coins imitating the Anglo-Saxon series were 
struck until c. 1020, when Cnut the Great was striking his own coinage, this particular type, among the earliest issues, probably did not even 
last to the end of the reign of Svend Forkbeard.

Alfonso I d&apos;Este was a true Renaissance prince. Shortly after he became duke, he uncovered a plot against him that involved two of his 
brothers. Tried for high treason, they were convicted and sentenced to be executed. However, Alfonso commuted their sentences to life 
imprisonment. 

During the Italian Wars, Alfonso maintained a delicate balance between the warring factions, while strengthening Ferrara&apos;s fortifications 
against attack. Joining the League of Cambrai, he sided with the French against Pope Julius II. For this, Alfonso was excommunicated and 
relieved of his territories, which now became part of the Papal States. Alfonso was not to be undone, using Ferrara&apos;s superior artillery made 
from fragments of Michelangelo&apos;s equestrian statue of Julius, he assisted in several significant victories against the Pope, and the emperor 
Charles V subsequently rewarded Alfonso&apos;s assistance with the restoration of his lands. 

Alfonso was also a patron of the arts. He patronized Giovanni Bellini and Titian, who painted for him several works, including a portrait of 
the Duke leaning on one of his cannons. In 1529, Alfonso built a magnificent art gallery. Known as the Camerino, this white marble-veneered 
chamber with gilded ceiling housed his impressive collection. 

Alfonso was married twice. His first wife, Anna, was the sister of Gian Galeazzo Sforza, and the niece of Alfonso&apos;s own sister, Beatrice. After 
Anna&apos;s death in childbirth, Alfonso married Lucrezia Borgia, the daughter of Pope Alexander VI and sister of Cesare Borgia, and whose name 
became a by-word for Renaissance ruthlesness.

The Fiorino d&apos;oro -known in English as the gold Florin -was introduced in 1252, and depicted on its obverse the lily, symbol of Florence, 
and on the reverse a figure of St. John. At the time, Mediterranean trade was dominated by the bezant, a colloquial name for the gold dinars 
of the various Islamic and Crusader states. But the Fiorino, proving to be a sound and reliable coin, soon overcame the bezants in popularity, 
thus becoming the first European gold trade coinage since Roman times. The type was imitated throughout Europe, with vast numbers struck 
not only in Florence, but in Hungary, France, and Spain as well. These early imitations generally conformed to the lily/Saint type, with later 
issues gradually developing more local types, while still retaining the Florentine weight standard.

Louis XII seized control of Milan early in 1499, ousting the ruling Sforzas. In 1508, under the leadership of Pope Julius II, the French joined 
with the Holy Roman Empire and Spain in the League of Cambrai against Venice. The alliance soon fell apart, however, due to the League&apos;s 
inability to follow up their successes and the Pope&apos;s growing distrust of the French. The Holy League was formed in 1510, an alliance of 
the Pope, Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, and England against Louis XII. The stunning French victory under Gaston de Foix at Ravenna in 
1512 was quickly overshadowed by his death during that battle. At the same time, the Swiss invasion of Milan compelled Louis to withdraw 
completely from his Italian interests.

The denaro was an Italian version of the Carolingian denier, introduced in 755 under Pepin I. Among other things, this new denomination 
established a uniform weight, fineness, and design. It also established a set relationship between the Carolingian silver denier, which had 
become the main denomination, and the fictional denominations of account -the shilling and the gold solidus -that were employed to handle 
larger sums. Under Charlemagne, this reform was implemented fully and expanded to meet the needs of his ever-increasing empire. Initially, 
Charlemagne&apos;s deniers followed the weight and general type of Pepin I. As new sources of silver were discovered, and as Charlemagne 
acquired more power and territory, he issued new, heavier deniers at his imperial mints (including the Italian ones), which continued under 
his successors. The denier became so popular as an international currency that early feudal issuers continued the coinage for their own areas, 
long after the Carolingian rulers themselves were gone. The Carolingian denier (and its fraction, the obole) continued as a denominational type 
throughout western Europe in the form of the denar, denaro, and even the English penny (notated as d. in accounting) for most of the Middle 
Ages until the introduction of the larger gros in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.

Since the time of Pepin I (754/5-768), the Franks acted as the protectors of the Papacy, first defending it against the Lombards, and then 
securing the territory around Rome -subsequently known as the Papal States -through the Donation of Pepin in 756. In return, Pepin was 
elevated to Patricius Romanus, a title that implied papal protection and the recogniton of the king as the de facto authority in the formerly 
Byzantine Duchy of Rome and the Exarchate of Ravenna. Upon Charlemagne&apos;s succession as King of the Lombards in 774, this title was 
granted to him as well by Adrian I, the predecessor of Leo III. This appointment proved to be a catalyst in the events that followed, concluding 
with Leo III crowning Charlemagne as the first Holy Roman Emperor on Christmas Day 800. 

Elected on the same day that his predecessor, Adrian I, was buried, Leo III established a close political relationship with Charlemagne from 
the very beginning of his Papacy. His predecessor&apos;s relatives, fearful of the new Pope&apos;s relationship with the powerful Frankish king, plotted to 
dethrone Leo, going so far as to accuse him of adultery and perjury. Attacked near the Flaminian Gate by a body of armed men, who sought to 
rip out his tongue and his eyes, Leo was rescued by two of Charlemagne&apos;s envoys (missi dominici) who were present. Eventually, the fugitive 
Pope made his way to Charlemagne&apos;s court at Paderborn, where he was received with great honor. Escorting Leo back to Rome, Charlemagne 
held a council on 1 December 800 with the representatives of Leo and his accusers. Following Leo&apos;s Oath of Purgation, a Medieval proof of 
innocence, he was exonerated and his accusers were exiled. In return for the Frankish king&apos;s support, Leo crowned Charlemagne as emperor 
of the Holy Roman Empire.

Frederick II Hohenstaufen, &quot;Stupor Mundi&quot; (&quot;Wonder of the World&quot;), was the most enlightened ruler of the medieval European world, and 
single-handedly almost ignited a renaissance a century before it took hold in western Europe. Besides encouraging the study of both the 
ancient and natural worlds (he wrote an insightful treatise on falconry), Frederick was instrumental in improving relations with the Muslims, 
negotiating free access to Christian holy sites in Palestine, where all Crusader armies had been unsuccessful. One of his innovations was a 
gold coinage comparable in style and quality to the gold of the ancient Caesars. The classical motifs proclaimed his inheritance of the legacy 
of Rome, and the augustale and its fractions were issued concurrently with the publication of the Constitution of Melfi, his codification of 
Norman law meant to follow the famous Roman law codes. These coins were struck until Frederick&apos;s death in 1250, and may have been 
continued by his successors for about another fifteen years.

The English crown was never particularly concerned with supplying the American colonists with coinage. Early settlers in New England had 
to make due with bartered goods, Native American wampum, and whatever scraps of coinage trickled up from the Spanish territories to the 
far south. Such a situation was untenable for the booming markets of Boston, yet coinage was considered a royal prerogative, and without 
permission of the monarch the colonial officials were hamstrung. In 1652, with the dissolution of the monarchy and the establishment of the 
Commonwealth of England, officials in Boston were at last free to take matters into their own hands. 

On 26-27 May 1652, the General Court of Massachusetts Bay Colony authorized the creation of a mint to strike silver shillings, sixpence, and 
threepence. These represent the earliest coinage struck in what is today the United States. Four separate issues were struck: the NE issues, 
crude types bearing only the letters NE and the denomination; the Willow Tree issues, with a willow tree for the obverse type; the Oak Tree 
issues, with an oak; and the Pine Tree issues, with a pine tree. These series were struck over a number of years, until the mintmasters&apos; contracts 
expired in 1682. All coins bear a fixed date of 1652, the date of authorization. Early collectors believed that this date was used to deceive 
English officials into believing the series was only struck during the Commonwealth, though this seems highly unlikely, as documentary 
evidence clearly demonstrates that the monarchy was well aware of New England&apos;s silver coinage.

The Princeps Collection of Transylvania -Part I 

Transylvania (derived from the medieval Latin ultra silvam = &quot;beyond the forest&quot;) is an area located in the Carpathian basin in modern day 
Romania. Situated near the edges of the Mediterranean and Eastern European worlds, the region has long been at the confluence of various 
cultures. Transylvania was inhabited in ancient times by the Dacians, a Thracian people, before being conquered by the Roman emperor Trajan 
in AD 106, adding a wealthy, silver-rich province to the Empire. After the withdrawal of the Romans under Aurelian, the region found itself 
at the front lines of the Great Migrations, and control of the area passed between Goths, Gepids, Vandals, Sarmatians, and Huns, as nomadic 
tribes flowed southeastward through Europe. 

In the 11th century, Stephen I, the first Christian king of Hungary, led his army into the region to conquer the native Slavic and Romanian 
peoples, beginning the Hungarian settlement pf the region. Over the following centuries, these Hungarians would come to dominate the 
politics of the region, ruling as vovoides (dukes), and maintaining varying degrees of independence, while still swearing fealty to the kings 
of Hungary. By the mid-12th century, Hungarian kings, seeking to protect their eastern border, encouraged German settlement, leading to 
the addition of a third major ethnic group to the region. Among the various waves of German settlers were a number of the famed Teutonic 
Knights, who constructed a number of fortifications in the area, giving Transylvania its German name of Siebenbürgen (&quot;seven forts&quot;). 

From the late 16th century onward, Transylvanian history was characterized by the struggle between the rising power of the Hapsburgs to the 
west, and the encroaching Ottoman Empire to the east. The local rulers struggled to retain their autonomy between these two massive empires, 
beginning with the rebel Eastern Hungarian Kingdom of Szapolyai kings, who contested the Hapsburg accession to the Hungarian throne. 
These monarchs, as well as their princely successors, would generally seek the protection of the Ottoman sultan against the greater threat of 
the Austrians. Perennial conflicts wracked the region, as Ottoman and Austrian armies raged back and forth, punctuated by brutal civil wars 
between various foreign-supported claimants. The Hapsburgs eventually took the upper hand after their victory over the Ottomans at the Battle 
of Vienna in 1683, leading to the loss of Ottoman protection for Transylvania and the deposition of the native rulers in 1691. The territory of 
Transylvania was fully incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire as a Grand Principality in 1745. 

The complicated history of the region resulted in the production of an interesting and artistically important coinage. The 16th-18th century 
issues of Transylvania are among the most impressive issues struck in Europe at the time. In addition to the usual minors, talers, and ducats, the 
Transylvanian princes produced a number of large gold and silver multiples, both in the usual circular format and in more exotic hexagonal, 
sun, and moon shapes. During the various conflicts, several interesting necessity pieces were also struck. In addition, a number of the talers 
and multiples were restruck in the 19th century, on behalf of Adolf Resch, author of Siebenbürgischen Münzen und Medaillen, the standard 
reference on the series. 

Classical Numismatic Group is proud to present Part I of the Princeps Collection, featuring gold and silver coinage of Transylvania. Part II, to 
be offered in Triton XX session 5 (Electronic Auction 389), will feature minor coinage of the region, with additional offerings to appear next 
year in Triton XXI and its accompanying electronic auction. Please note that all of the following lots are from the Princeps Collection, with 
the exception of lots 1342 and 1422.

According to John Creighton (Coins and Power in Late Iron Age Britain [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000] pp. 191-2), Roman 
influence is seen in the coinage of the late Atrebatic kings. On the coins, Tincomarus and Verica both name themselves as son of Commius, an 
earlier ruler with a fluctuating relationship with Rome. Initially an ally of Caesar in Gaul, Commius later rebelled and joined in the revolt of 
Vercingetorix, before eventually becoming king in southern Britain. After his death, Tincomarus and, to a greater extent, Verica established an 
ancestor cult venerating the former ruler and developed a program of images roughly mirroring that of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. The coins 
are inscribed COMmii Filius, son of Commius, and bear various images relating to the divine pedigree of Verica and the new age of prosperity, 
such as the vine leaf on the present coin.

The Dr. Andrew Wayne Collection of Anglo-Saxon Coins -Part Three 
Incorporating Other Important Properties 

This third offering further confirms Dr. Wayne&apos;s remarkable achievement in amassing a collection of such scope and quality. 

Among many highlights presented for sale is an exceedingly rare gold shilling of Eadbald, the first English king to be named 
on a coin (1463); choice portrait types of Baldred of Kent (1474) and Ceolwulf I and Beornwulf of Mercia (1494 &amp; 1495); 
extremely rare pennies of the Hiberno-Norse kings of Northumbria including an example of Anlaf&apos;s iconic Raven type 
probably struck in Lincoln (1514) and a Triquetra type of Regnald Gurthfrithsson that we believe to be the first ever offered 
at public auction (1517). Mention should also be made of the beautiful Minster type Penny of Edward the Elder (1531), the 
Tower type of Aethelstan from the Ryedale hoard (1536) and the unique floral type of Eadred (1538). 

In addition to Dr. Wayne&apos;s coins CNG is pleased to offer two pennies of the the most famous Viking of all, Eric Bloodaxe 
(1518 &amp; 1519); a unique and unpublished gold shilling of considerable iconographic interest (1465), and a superb Cross and 
Lozenge portrait penny of Alfred the Great (1526).

From the Dr. Andrew Wayne Collection. Ex Spink 203 (24 June 2010), lot 1 and front cover; found near Deal, Kent, January 2010. 

The first and only king to be named on a coin in this period, Eadbald&apos;s succession to the Kentish throne proved a considerable set back to 
the nascent English Church established by St Augustine during the reign of Aethelberht, Eadbald&apos;s father, the first Anglo-Saxon king to be 
baptized. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for 616 relates that Eabald &apos;abondoned his baptism and lived by heathen custom, inasmuch as he had his 
father&apos;s widow as wife. Then Laurentius, who was Archbishop in Kent, decided to go south across the sea to Rome and abandon it all: but the 
apostle Peter came to him in the night and fiercely scourged him because he wished to abandon God&apos;s flock thus, and ordered him to go to the 
king and preach the true faith to him. And he did so and the king was baptized.&apos; Eadbald would go on to rule for 25 years during which time he 
successfully maintained Kentish independence against the growing power of Northumbria, helped foster the growth of the English Church and 
retain relations with Merovingian Gaul. Eight coins naming Eadbald are known of which only this piece and one other are in private hands.

ANGLO-SAXON, Post-Crondall Phase. Circa 655-675. AV Thrymsa -Shilling (13mm, 1.26 g, 6h). Uncertain 
mint. + ΛVИΛQHTΛVOΛ in margin, bare head, with hair in rows of curls, right within coiled snake / + ΛOmCИVΛTOΛ, 
Latin cross set on annulet, annulets at ends of limbs, all within two concentric dotted circles terminating at the base annulet. 
Unpublished, but cf. SCBI 60 (BM), 21 for a similar reverse type on a gold issue, and 78-86 for similar types and iconography 
on silver sceatts (Series B1Ai [BMC Type 27b]). EMC 2016.0213 (this coin). EF, a few light marks. Well centered on a broad 
flan. Unique. 
($20,000) 

This beautiful and remarkable coin was discovered in May of 2016 by metal detectorist, Dave Rodgers, near Wragby, North Lincolnshire. The 
apparent gold content and elements of the design bear comparison with other types in the post-Crondall phase suggesting a date of issue in 
the 660s or 670s. Unprecedented in the entire Anglo-Saxon gold coinage is the profile head on depicted within a coiled snake consuming its 
own tail. This apotropaic motif, known as an ouroboros, hitherto only found on the silver sceatt coinage which followed the gold shillings, has 
been discussed by Anna Gannon in her excellent work on the complex iconography of early Anglo-Saxon coinage. For Gannon the ouroboros 
is both &apos;keeper of treasures/protector of the hero in Germanic myths&apos; and an allegory for Christ as protector of the soul. The overtly Christian 
cross on the reverse of this coin is entirely appopriate. This coin will be the subject of an article by Tony Abramson in the forthcoming 2017 
edition of the British Numismatic Journal.

This coin shares an obverse die and anomalous style with the unique Raven penny struck by the moneyer Odeler. Both the authors of CTCE 
and Mark Blackburn believed that the coin of Odeler should be attributed to a mint other than York. Lincoln has been proposed. The fact that 
the moneyer Litleman is only otherwise known to strike for the kings of Wessex namely Aethelstan, Eadmund, and Eadwig strengthens this 
view.

An experienced soldier and ardent Royalist, Colonel Sir Thomas Armstrong, fought for the Crown in Ireland during the Great Rebellion. 
Imprisoned twice under the Commonwealth Armstrong was rewarded for his loyalty by Charles II following the Restoration in 1660 with a 
patent to coin farthings for use in Ireland for 21 years. It appears that the dies were prepared by Thomas Rawlins on account of the R evident 
on the band of the crown on obverse and the use of lozenge stops; both features characteristic of Rawlins&apos; dies at Oxford during the Civil War. 
Comparatively few of these farthings appear to have been issued before Armstrong&apos;s death in 1662, partly due to opposition from the Duke 
of Ormonde, Armstrong&apos;s old comrade in arms. Coins issued for currency tend to be struck on thin flans and all bear the feathers mint mark 
on the reverse unlike our pattern piece.

Hoping to take advantage of British involvement in the American War of Independence (1775-1782), Spain and France fought to retake the 
island of Gibraltar. Known as the Great Siege of Gibraltar (1779-1782), it was numerically one of the largest actions fought during that time, 
and the longest siege endured by British armed forces. Gibraltar is a rugged peninsula, located on the coast of Spain, it was considered to 
be one of the Pillars of Hercules, the ancient gateway between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean. During the War of the Spanish 
Sucession (1701-1715), a combined English and Dutch fleet captured Gibraltar from the Spanish. Under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht 
(1713), Gibraltar was ceded to the British, who subsequently fortified it as a naval base in the Mediterranean, making its name synonymous 
with an impregnable fortress. In 1727, the Spanish tried unsuccessfully to lay siege to it, and again, during the War of Jenkins&apos; Ear (1739-
1748), when their plans to establish nearby trenches was thwarted by the strengthening of the British squadron there by Admiral Vernon, fresh 
from his victory at Portobello (see lot 1624 for a Portobello medal of Admiral Vernon). In 1779, a combined French and Spanish operation 
once again laid siege to Gibraltar, as part of each country&apos;s attempt to help the other recover territory lost to Britain. 

At the time of the siege, British forces on Gibraltar were under the command of George Augustus Eliott, its governor from 1770 until his death 
in 1790. A veteran of the Royal Engineers, he once served in the Prussia Army under Friedrich Wilhelm I, and was an Aide-de-camp to George 
II, Eliott distinguishing himself during the Seven Years&apos; War (1756-1763). He was second-in-command at the capture of Havana in 1762. A 
few years before his appointment to Gibraltar, Eliott was made a Privy Counsellor and temporary governor of Londonderry. Anticipating the 
siege, Eliott applied his experience in the Engineers by shoring up Gibraltar&apos;s fortifications. Prior to the Grand Assault of 13 September 1782, 
the Spanish attempted to starve the British garrison. Eliott, ever an abstemious individual, in a letter posted during the initial period of the 
siege (late September 1779), stated simply, &quot;Nothing new. G.A.E..&quot; 

On 13 September 1782, the combined French and Spanish forces launched their great attack against Gibraltar. Known as the Grand Assault, 
ten newly engineered &quot;floating batteries&quot;, as 18 ships-of-the-line, 40 gunboats and 20 bomb-vessels, were tasked to destroy the fortifications. 
Once this was completed, a combined land force of 35,000 Spanish and 7,000 to 8,000 French troops, as well as 86 cannon, would assault 
those same fortifications once they had been demolished. Over 80,000 spectators occupied the adjacent hills over the Spanish border, among 
whom were members of the Spanish aristocracy, hoping to watch, &quot;the British flag trailed in the dust.&quot; (R. Chartrand and P. Courcelle, 
Gibraltar 1779-1783: The Great Siege [Gibraltar: 2006], p. 65). But, when the guns of the floating batteries opened fire, the British garrison 
replied with red-hot shot to set fire to and sink them. Among the three floating batteries that blew up as a result of this red-hot shot was the 
Pastora, commanded by Rear-Admiral Buenaventura Moreno. To commemorate this, badges, possibly manufactured within the fortress and 
hand engraved with a design of the event and the names of the recipients, were presented to the members of the actual battery that sank the 
ship (see next lot).

The night of the 16th/17th of June saw the hurried retreat of Wellington&apos;s forces from Quatre Bras to the ridge at Waterloo, which the Duke 
had noted during his inspection of the countryside in the autumn of 1814. The French forces were by this move forced into a frontal attack up 
the slopes toward a line of fortified farms. The allies numbered some 63,000 men and 156 guns. Late in the morning of the 18th, the French 
attacked the flanks of the allied position, the Chateau of Hougoumont on the right and the fortified farm of La Haye Sainte in the middle. The 
allies were outnumbered in both men and guns, and in the face of a fierce artillery barrage, Wellington moved his troops further back over the 
ridge. Marshal Ney advanced his troops and fully expected to overrun the British lines but such was the fierceness of the allied musket fire that 
virtually none of the enemy came within bayonet distance. By six o&apos;clock in the evening, Ney&apos;s efforts were too late, since the Prussians under 
Field-Marshal von Blücher had arrived and were harassing the flanks of the French troops. After a final, ineffectual attack by Ney, Wellington 
ordered his cavalry to attack and utterly routed the French; the final pursuit was left to the Prussians who harried the fleeing French throughout 
the night. By Blücher&apos;s timely appearance on the field of battle, Wellington&apos;s victory was the more complete and the Prussian Field-Marshal 
became popular in England as a result of it. The City of London conferred the freedom of the city on him and Oxford made him a D. C. L. 

In 1816, Pistrucci was invited to submit designs for this medal, which it was intended to strike in gold and give to the allied sovereigns, their 
ministers and generals. In August 1819, Treasury authority was given for the work to begin on the preparation of models. Unfortunately, due to 
a disagreement between Pistrucci and the Master of the Mint over the office of the Chief Engraver, the work proceeded very slowly. Pistrucci 
thought that the office, which had been given to William Wyon (who had been performing those duties for some time) should have gone to 
him. Pistrucci held the office of Chief Medallist to the King for which he received a salary of £300 a year plus another £50 for the instruction 
of a pupil, but nevertheless felt disgruntled at not being given the more senior position. In 1832, Lord Auckland, the then Master of the Mint, 
remonstrated with Pistrucci over the delay in producing the medal and Pistrucci requested an assurance that if he completed the medal his 
connections with the Mint would not be terminated. Lord Auckland would not give such an undertaking and once more the work lapsed. To 
make matters worse, the additional £50 that Pistrucci had been receiving as part of his salary was withdrawn. Further queries were raised with 
Pistrucci in 1842, but again, arguments over the matter of salary delayed work. It was not until August 1844 that agreement over the salary 
was reached, whereby it was raised from £300 to £350 a year and work upon the medal was resumed. In 1849, the Master of the Mint was 
able to report that the dies were complete, but by this time each of the four allied sovereigns depicted on the obverse (and no doubt many of 
the other intended recipients of the medal) were dead. 

Because of the difficulty of hardening dies of the size required to strike the medal, Pistrucci made each die in two parts, an outer ring which 
was fitted around a central die of 71mm diameter. Each of these was to be hardened separately. Despite his suggestions, the dies were 
never hardened and only gutta-percha impressions and electrotypes were made. These sometimes occur joined together and the gutta-percha 
impressions are found in a black japanned metal case. The wax model for the medal is in the Mint Museum in Rome and the dies are in the 
Royal Mint Museum, London. (from BHM)

The China trade was initially a remarkably one-sided affair, with a staggering demand for Chinese goods in the west, but scant need for 
western goods in China. But in the early 19th century, the British finally found a popular commodity and began to trade Indian opium to the 
Chinese in exchange for silver. This caused a reversal in flow of specie: where once New World and European silver flowed into China to pay 
for tea and porcelain, filling the Qing coffers, Chinese silver now flowed west to pay for addictive opium. With the drug not only weakening 
the minds of the populace, but also the treasury of the state, China banned the trade in opium in 1839, ordering all stocks seized. 

British merchants found the prohibition of such a popular trade good unacceptable and the situation soon escalated to war. Unfortunately for 
the Chinese, the Royal navy&apos;s steamships and modern rifles soundly defeated the antiquated Qing forces. The war ended in 1842, beginning 
what is known as the &quot;Century of Humiliation&quot; for the Chinese. The Treaty of Nanking forced them to cede to the British the city of Hong 
Kong, as well as pay an indemnity of 21 million dollars in silver. So much silver was paid to the British that, when it was melted down at the 
Royal mint, enough gold was extracted to permit the striking of a series of small medals.

($6000) 

Instituted in 1847, the Naval General Service Medal (along with the Military General Service Medal) was issued to officers and men who had 
served in various naval actions between 1793 and 1840, and included actions in the French Revolutionary Wars, the Napoleonic Wars, and 
the Anglo-American War of 1812. To denote the pertinent military action, a special clasp, known as a bar, indicating the service, was attached 
to the ribbon. 

The Battle of Lake Borgne occurred on 14 December 1814 between the British Navy, including the Royal Marines, and the US Navy, as well 
as the US Marines. Following their inability to take the city of Mobile, the British then decided to attack New Orleans. Learning of this action, 
the American commander of the New Orleans Squadron, Commodore Daniel Patterson, assembled all available types of naval defenses to 
protect Louisiana&apos;s numerous coastal waterways. Upon the arrival of the British at Lake Borgne, they were met with a small American flotilla 
of five gunboats, a schooner, and two sloops-of-war acting as tenders. While proceeding to the head of the lake, from where they would 
disembark to begin the attack on New Orleans, three of the British ships were fired upon. The British commander of one of the British ships, 
Commander Nicholas Lockyer, was ordered to find and defeat the American ships. After a lengthy search, Lockyer found the Americans 
blocking one of the main channels. After a two-hour battle, the British, who greatly outnumbered the Americans, won the engagement 
and gained control of the waters around New Orleans. The Americans, on the other hand, did considerable damage and delayed the British 
advance, providing General Andrew Jackson additional time to strengthen the defenses of the city. 

According the the London Gazette for 28 January 1849, 205 British survivors of the battle claimed the special bar.

John Brown served as personal servant and trusted confidant to Queen Victoria for over twenty years. He initially entered the service of 
Prince Albert as personal gillie or hunting attendant, transferring to the court only after Albert&apos;s death. Brown and Victoria grew quite close, 
leading many to become jealous and suspicious of the informal nature of their relationship. Edward VII, in particular, disliked the man. On his 
mother&apos;s death in 1901, he orderrd the many busts and photographs of Brown -commissioned by Victoria both before and after his death -to 
be removed. 

Though apparently unpublished, the British Museum has a similar piece in gold, fashioned into a tie-pin, bearing the same portrait flanked by 
the letters J B, with a reverse reading FROM VRI and bearing a monogram. (Private communication with Philip Attwood, Keeper of Coins
