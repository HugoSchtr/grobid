AUCTION TERMS 

This is a public, mail bid, and internet auction conducted by Classical 
Numismatic Group, Inc. (CNG). Bidding in the auction constitutes 
acceptance of the following terms: 

1. 
The property listed in this catalogue is offered for sale by 
CNG for itself and as agent for various owners and other consignors. 
We reserve the right to reject any bid, to determine the opening price, 
to set bidding increments, to vary the order of the auction, to reopen 
bidding in the case of a dispute, to withdraw any lot, to bid on behalf 
of CNG, to bid on behalf of the consignor, to permit the auctioneer to 
bid on his own behalf, and to permit the consignor to bid on his own 
lots. CNG may loan or advance money to consignors or prospective 
bidders, and may have an interest other than commission charges in 
any lot. CNG may bid on its own account as an &quot;insider&quot; with infor-
mation not available to the public. 

2. 
A buyer&apos;s fee will be charged to all successful bidders as fol-
lows on the hammer price: 
A. 22.5% for written, fax, email, telephone, and live internet bids. 
B. 20% for floor bids placed in person at the auction and electronic 
bids placed directly on www.cngcoins.com. 
All written bids, email bids, non-live telephone bids, live internet bid 
registrations, and live telephone bid registrations must be received 
before 5PM Eastern time on the day before the auction begins. CNG 
reserves the right to change the format of www.cngcoins.com at any 
time. 

3. 
All coins are guaranteed genuine. Attribution, date, condi-
tion, and other descriptions are the opinion of the cataloguer, and no 
warranty is expressed or implied. Please note that an auction sale 
is not an approval sale. Lots examined prior to the sale and lots 
purchased by floor bidders (including bidders executing commission 
bids on behalf of other parties) may not be returned for any reason 
except lack of authenticity. All claims of misdescription and all 
claims of return, except claims regarding authenticity, must be made 
within 5 days of receipt of material. Any claim of lack of authenticity 
must be made in writing by the original purchaser immediately after 
discovery that an item is not authentic, and upon making such a claim 
the original purchaser must immediately return the lot to CNG in the 
same condition as at the time of the auction. Coins that have been 
encapsulated (&quot;slabbed&quot;) by a grading and/or authentication service 
may not be returned for any reason, including authenticity, if they 
have been removed from the encapsulation (&quot;slab&quot;). If payment is 
made by credit card, rights of return are governed by these Auction 
Terms which supercede any rights of return promulgated by the card 
issuer. Estimates are intended as a guide only and not as a statement 
of opinion of value. 

4. 
Invoices are due and payable immediately upon receipt. 
Interest and late fees of 2.0% per month, or at the highest rate permit-
ted by law, whichever is less, from the date of the auction, shall be 
payable on invoices not settled within 30 days of the auction date. 
Payment may be made by check or bank wire. Credit cards (Visa 
or MasterCard) will be accepted; credit card payments will not be 
accepted more than 14 days after the sale date. Payment by check 
must be made in either US dollars ($) drawn on a US bank or British 
sterling (£) drawn on a British bank. All successful bidders outside 
North America and the United Kingdom will be charged an additional 
$20 fee for bank charges that are the result of international wire trans-
fer fees; this fee will be deducted for credit card or check payment as 
described above. CNG may reduce or compromise any charge or fee 
at its discretion. 

5. 
Bidders not known to us must provide us with satisfactory 
credit references or pay a deposit as determined at CNG&apos;s discretion 
before bidding. Minors are not permitted to bid without written con-
sent of a parent guaranteeing payment. CNG may require payment 
in full from any bidder prior to delivery of lots. Title does not pass 
until lots are paid in full. Upon receipt of lots, the buyer assumes full 
responsibility for loss or damage. Delivery to the buyer&apos;s address of 
record shall constitute receipt by the buyer regardless of the identity 
of the person accepting delivery. 

6. 
Estimates are in U.S. dollars ($US) and bids must be in 
even dollar ($) amounts. CNG will execute mail bids on behalf of 
mail bidders. Subject to reserves and opening prices, mail bids will be 
executed at one bidding increment (approximately 10%) over the next 
highest bid. In the case of identical bids, the earliest bid wins. A mail 
bid has priority over an identical floor bid. Bid by lot number. No lots 
will be broken. Bidders are responsible for errors in bidding. Check 
your bid sheet carefully. 

7. 
All lots are subject to reserve unless otherwise indicated. 
However, no reserve will be higher than the estimate, and ordinarily 
lots are reserved at 60% of estimate. 

8. 
Bidders personally guarantee payment for their successful 
bids, including bidders executing commission bids from other parties 
and bidders representing corporations or other entities. Buyers accept-
ing commission bids from other parties do so at their own risk and 
remain responsible for payment under these Auction Terms. 

9. 
At the conclusion of bidding for each lot, the sale contract is 
concluded and the successful bidder becomes liable for immediate 
payment under these Auction Terms. In the event a successful bidder 
fails to make full payment within 30 days of the auction date, CNG 
reserves the right either: (a) to require payment as provided under 
these Auction Terms; or (b) to deem the sale incomplete and to re-auc-
tion the material, in which case the successful bidder agrees to pay for 
the reasonable cost of such a sale and also to pay any shortfall between 
the re-auction price and the successful bidder&apos;s purchase price. CNG 
reserves all rights that it is entitled to under the Pennsylvania Uniform 
Commercial Code, including the right to offset any sums due from a 
successful bidder against any future consignment or purchase or mon-
ies or goods in possession of CNG. 

10. 
Sales tax, postage, handling and insurance are the responsibil-
ity of the buyer and are added to all invoices where appropriate. For 
buyers in the European Union, CNG may import lots into the United 
Kingdom prior to shipment and charge buyers the import Value Added 
Tax. On any tax not paid by the purchaser which should have been 
paid, even if not invoiced by CNG, the purchaser agrees to pay the 
same on demand together with any interest or penalty that may be 
assessed. It is the responsibility of the buyer to comply with foreign 
customs and other regulations. 

11. 
Prices realized are published after the sale and are mailed with 
CNG&apos;s next publication. Prices realized are also posted after the sale 
on CNG&apos;s web site: www.cngcoins.com 

12. 
Bidders hereby waive any claim for incidental, consequential 
or exemplary damages arising from this auction. The sole remedy that 
any participant in the auction shall have for any claim or controversy 
arising out of the auction shall be a refund, without interest, of all or 
part of the purchase price paid by the participant. 

13. 
All rights granted by CNG or otherwise available to bidders 
and purchasers, under these Auction Terms or otherwise, are personal 
and may not be assigned or transferred to any other person or entity, 
whether by operation of law or otherwise. No third party may rely on 
any benefit or right conferred by these Auction Terms. Bidders acting 
as agents must disclose the agency in writing to CNG prior to the auc-
tion; otherwise rights are limited to the agent and are not transferable 
to the undisclosed principal. 

14. 
Any dispute regarding this auction shall be governed by the 
laws of Pennsylvania and shall be adjudicated only by the Lancaster 
County Court of Common Pleas or the U.S. District Court for the 
Eastern District of Pennsylvania; all bidders submit themselves to 
the personal jurisdiction of these courts for this purpose, consent 
to service of process by registered or certified mail, and waive any 
contrary provisions of Articles 14 or 15 of the French Civil Code and 
any similar provisions in any jurisdiction. All bidders consent to the 
confidentiality of consignors&apos; identities and waive any right to require 
disclosure of the name of the consignor or owner of any auction lot, 
whether such right is based on New York GOL  §5-701(a) or any other 
provision in any jurisdiction. In any dispute regarding this auction, the 
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and 
attorney fees.

Introduction 

The coinage made in Alexandria during the Roman Empire has fascinated collectors and scholars for 
a very long time. The attraction of the coinage lies in its unique mixture of the Roman, the Greek, and 
the Egyptian -all elements that we can see prominently featured on a coinage that was made for 300 
years, from Augustus (31 BC-AD 14) to Diocletian (284-305). The obverses of the coins always feature 
a portrait of the emperor and the empress, and many of the portraits are executed with great skill and 
aesthetic sense. But it is perhaps the diversity of the designs that are found on the reverses of the coins 
that are the more interesting. They include deities of the Greco-Roman pantheon, such as Zeus or Athena; 
they include Egyptian gods like Hermanubis or the personification of the river Nile; and they regularly 
show the Roman emperor, often in a military manner and sometimes celebrating an imperial journey, 
such as that of Nero to Greece or Hadrian to Egypt. Few other provincial coins of the Roman Empire 
show this variety of designs, and none has the number of different designs that we find at Alexandria. 

The Staffieri collection has a fine representation of all periods of the coinage, from its beginnings under 
Augustus until its last issues under Diocletian. Every period is well represented in the collection, and 
many of the pieces are both rare and in exceptional condition. A particular strength of the collection 
is the large number of bronze drachms, mostly minted in the second century AD. These coins were 
made on large flans, and the big size gave the engravers the opportunity to produce some very fine and 
interesting designs. 

This is a scholar&apos;s collection, reflecting Giovanni Staffieri&apos;s deep understanding and appreciation of the 
complexities of the coinage. His own publications on different aspects of the coinage are well known, 
and provide essential reading for anyone with a serious interest in the topic -for example, his articles 
on the puzzling way that sometimes the portrait of the emperor shows him with a radiate portrait; his 
explanation of the extraordinary ΕΙC ΖΕΥC CΑΡΑΠΙC coin of Hadrian; or his study of the complicated 
ending of the coinage at the end of the third century AD, when the distinctively Alexandrian coinage 
was transformed into the more banal and empire-wide system of uniform coinage introduced as part of 
Diocletian&apos;s administrative reforms. 

I had known of Giovanni Staffieri&apos;s publications and of his collections for many years, but I had never 
met him or viewed the coins. But, a few years ago, as part of the preparations for Volume III of Roman 
Provincial Coinage, it became obvious that it was necessary to get in contact with him, to ask about the 
many rare and unusual coins that were in his collection. A tentative first email met an immediate and 
warm response, and led to a memorable visit to see the collection, a collection whose extent took me so 
much by surprise that it was necessary to work well into the night to get through it in the days available. 
Hard work and serious conversations about the coins were complemented by the legendary and generous 
hospitality offered to me by Giovanni and Maggie: a visit that was demanding but rewarding, on both an 
intellectual and a personal level. We have remained friends ever since, and I am not alone in receiving 
this liberal welcome: all scholars and collectors with a serious interest in the coins have been met with 
the same mixture of enthusiasm and generosity. 

There have been other great collections -of Cardinal Borgia, already included in Jørgen Zoëga&apos;s catalogue 
of 1787; of Giovanni di Demetrio by Feuardent in 1873; or of Giovanni Dattari originally published by 
its owner in 1901. The Staffieri collection may not be as large as some of its predecessors, but it includes 
many unusual or unique pieces, some themselves originally from the Dattari collection, which was split 
up in the late 20th century. The quality of the collection and the interest of the catalogue mean that 
the Staffieri Collection will join these predecessors on the bookshelf of the most important books on 
Alexandrian coinage, and be consulted by many scholars, collectors, and historians for many years.

A Note from the Cataloguer 

It has been a rare privilege to catalog the following Alexandrian coins from the collection of Giovanni 
Maria Staffieri. I have been aware of Giovanni and his collection for a long time now, as he purchased 
quite a few &quot;old friends&quot; from my collection of Alexandrian coinage, when we sold the best pieces 
in December of 1990 (Classical Numismatic Auctions XIII). I finally was able to meet him in person 
at the XV th International Numismatic Congress held in Taormina, Sicily in September of 2015. At 
the Congress, Giovanni told me that he was working on a book devoted to his collection, which he 
completed earlier this year: Alexandria In Nummis, 30 a.C.-298 d.C. -Una passione -Una collezione. 
It is a wonderful book, worthy of such an impressive collection. 

Giovanni was born in Lugano, Switzerland in 1944. After completing his studies at the University of 
Zürich in 1969, he returned to his hometown to start his own business. After a successful career of 40 years, 
Giovanni retired in 2009, and was able to concentrate on his various avocations, including numismatics. 

A life member of the Swiss Numismatic Society since 1966 
(a gift from his father), Giovanni started attending meetings 
of the Society in Zürich on a regular basis in the 1970s, 
where he would meet Dr. Piero Beretta from Milan. It was 
Dr. Beretta who introduced him to the Roman coins from 
the mint of Alexandria in Egypt, and indeed, Giovanni 
purchased many of his best coins, almost all ex Dattari, 
from Dr. Beretta. Dr. Beretta, a classical art teacher, had 
the good fortune to purchase these coins directly from the 
Dattari collection when it was being dispersed. 

Giovanni has never been content with just being a collector, 
and indeed, his scholarly publications and articles are 
numerous and reflect his intense interest in the Alexandrian 
series. Several of his articles are cited in the following 
catalogue, and of course, every coin in this sale is listed 
(with full descriptions and commentary) by Giovanni in his 
book Alexandria In Nummis. 

The following 273 lots represent the finest and rarest coins from the Alexandrian collection of Giovanni 
Maria Staffieri, which includes 116 coins from the Giovanni Dattari collection -probably still one of 
the finest and most complete collections ever assembled. I am honored that Giovanni included 26 coins 
from my collection. Other notable collectors of Alexandrian coins represented in the pedigree chain 
of the Staffieri collection are: Lloyd Beauchaine, Renzo Canavesi, Colonel James W. Curtis, Philip 
DeVicci, Garth R. Drewry, Carlo Fontana, John Work Garrett, Tony Hardy, Marcel Jungfleisch, Richard 
Cyril Lockett, Dr. Meyer-Coloniensis, Athos Moretti, Giuseppe Nascia, Walter Niggeler, Jean-Pierre 
Righetti, David Simpson, Dr. Hans Steger, and Gilbert Steinberg. 

Finally, I have strived for accuracy in the following catalogue, but any errors found are my own.

A Note on the Collection 

In light of the number of improperly cleaned and often processed bronzes that pass through the market 
on a daily basis, it is truly refreshing to handle a collection acquired from such notable collectors as Dr. 
Piero Beretta, Renzo Canavesi, and Giovanni Dattari. These gentlemen had access to material found in 
the days before the use of chemicals and fertilizer in agriculture destroyed the natural surfaces of the 
bronzes. The Staffieri collection features a large number of such natural bronzes. 

The passion and pursuit of Giovanni Maria Staffieri is reflected in that this sale represents many of the 
finest pieces to come to auction since the advent of illustrated auction catalogues in the 19 th century. 

As with many specialized collections, I expect that buyers from around the world will be represented 
at this sale and that the coins will find many new homes. For those of you who can attend in person, 
viewing will be a pleasure.

Cleopatra VII, Queen of Egypt, was one of the most celebrated personalities of the ancient world. She is depicted here in her jubilant years, 
shortly after her ascension to the throne, circa 49 to 46 BC. This portrait of Cleopatra corresponds to the rare original marble, with its mutilated 
nose, which is preserved in the Vatican Museum (Museo Gregoriano Profano, Inv. 38511) -it was found in 1784 at the Villa dei Quintili on 
the Via Appia near Rome.

The first coinage of the new province of Egypt was a direct copy of the bronze coinage of Cleopatra, the last Ptolemaic ruler, with the portrait 
of Augustus replacing the Queen&apos;s. Egypt, wealthy and a vital source of grain for the empire, was to be never allowed again as a potential 
leaping-off point for a rival emperor. The new province was held under tight control by the emperor. Its governor was to be an equestrian 
prefect answerable to Augustus, with a legion under his direct command. The Senate would have no say in the administration of the province, 
and in fact, senators were forbidden to travel there without permission.

The frog is a representation of Heqet, an Egyptian goddess of fertility, who is often identified with Hathor. To the Egyptians, the frog was an 
ancient symbol of fertility, related to the annual flooding of the Nile. Heqet was considered the wife of Khnum, who formed the bodies of new

According to Emmett, this type was coined for Claudius&apos; regnal years 11-13 and 15. Agrippina Junior, wife and niece of Claudius, is 
assimilated to the goddess Euthenia (Abundance), the wife of Nilus, and symbol of agricultural prosperity, who appears on the reverse. The

This coin is one of the great rarities of the Alexandrian series, with only one other specimen having been offered for sale (Marcel Jungfleisch 
Collection, Sotheby&apos;s, 1972, lot 26, which also was holed twice in antiquity). Another, heavily worn example resides in the collection of the 
American Numismatic Society in New York City (mistakenly attributed to regnal year 11). 

Nero issued a prodigious amount of billon tetradrachms at the Alexandria mint. It has been speculated that this was part of his fund-raising 
campaign to rebuild Rome after the devastating fire of AD 64 (he melted down the higher silver content tetradrachms already in circulation, 
and replaced them with the lower silver content billon tetradrachms). As a result, bronze coinage in general was neglected during Nero&apos;s reign 
in Alexandria, especially the larger denominations -hemidrachm and drachm.

Vespasian. AD 69-79. AV Aureus (19mm, 7.86 g, 5h). Struck AD 70. IMP CAESAR VESPASIANVS AVG, laureate 
head right / COS ITER TOROT (sic), Pax standing facing, head left, holding grain ears in her extended right hand and a short 
caduceus with her left. RIC II 1527; Calicó -; RPC II 1904/3 (this coin -attributed to Antioch); Staffieri, Alexandria In Nummis 
31 (this coin). EF. Extremely rare, one of three known, with the other two in the American Numismatic Society and Bibliothèque 
Nationale collections. This coin is overstruck on an earlier aureus before Nero&apos;s weight reduction.

The attribution to Alexandria is not without controversy. Laffranchi first suggested Alexandria as the probable mint in his 1915 article 
(&quot;Sulla numismatica dei Flavia,&quot; RIN 28, pp. 139-54). William E. Metcalf compared the obverse style of two aurei to the Alexandrian 
billon tetradrachms for Vespasian&apos;s regnal year 2 in his article &quot;The Flavians in the East&quot; (Proceedings of the 9th International Congress 
of Numismatics, 1982, pp. 321-39), but a coin similar to our example was assigned by Metcalf to Antioch in Syria. The present collector, 
Giovanni Maria Staffieri, believes this and the following lot to have been struck at Alexandria, and he makes his case, also based on style, 
but to a larger extent based on the fact that we know Vespasian was &quot;raised to the purple&quot; in Alexandria on 1 July AD 69. The likelihood that 
Vespasian had precious metal coinage struck in the Latin style at Alexandria is indeed very plausible, but short of any actual hoard evidence, 
not absolutely certain.

Canopic jars were used to store the organs that were removed from the body during the mummification process, specifically the lungs, liver, 
stomach, and intestines. The term &quot;canopic&quot; to describe such vessels is a misnomer, being derived from the port city of Canopus, where the 
god Osiris was worshipped in the form of a jar.

During the first seven regnal years of his reign in Egypt, Vespasian continued the bronze types first started by Galba. Giovanni Maria Staffieri, 
in the catalog of his collection, speculates that perhaps a master engraver from Antioch in Syria was brought in to engrave the dies for this 
issue.

This is a rare type in general, but with Agathodaimon riding the horse to the left, instead of the usual horse to the right, it is extremely rare. 
The authors of RPC cite only three specimens, all in museum collections: American Numismatic Society, Berlin, and Copenhagen. As to the 
meaning of the reverse type, the horse represents the changing of the seasons, whereas the serpent represents regeneration or the rebirth of the 
crops. All of Egyptian life was dependent on this cycle.

Ex West Coast/Lloyd Beauchaine Collection (Classical Numismatic Group 41, 19 March 1997), lot 1111, purchased privately from B.A. Seaby 
Ltd; Dr. Hans Steger Collection (Münzhandlung Basel 6, 18 March 1936), lot 203. 

When this coin was last offered in our Auction 41, we noted that the reverse type had been traditionally attributed as the Uraeus -the serpent 
that the pharaoh wore on a diadem or crown -and indeed, this is still the universal designation for the type. However, as suggested by the 
consignor (Lloyd Beauchaine) to our sale 41, the more likely attribution is that of Isis-Thermouthis, a &apos;corn&apos; or grain goddess. Beauchaine 
based this attribution on the headdress of Isis, which is not a normal attribute of the Uraeus. There is a rare type issued by Domitian, also 
on an obol, that depicts Isis-Thermouthis as an uraeus serpent with the head of Isis (RPC II 2593, though called Demeter instead of Isis). As 
both of these types were issued during the same period (regnal years 10 and 11), it is possible that they were meant to depict the goddess in 
two of her different guises, a common occurrence in Egyptian art. We agreed with Beauchaine&apos;s interpretation in 1997, and find no reason to 
disagree with him now.

While often assumed to depict a local Egyptian monument, Fred Kleiner (&quot;An arch of Domitian in Rome on coins of Alexandria,&quot; NC 1989, 
pp. 69-81) has convincingly argued that the arch was erected elsewhere, almost certainly in the capital, to commemorate Domitian&apos;s victories 
in Germany. Indeed, Suetonius (Dom. 13.2) records that the emperor erected so many arci -Latin for arches -in Rome that a Greek punster 
wrote on one of them ἀρκεῖ (enough). 

It is also interesting to note that the production of Aes denominations finally started to increase at the Alexandrian mint during the reign of 
Domitian, and at the expense of the billon production.

its condition and quality are uncertain.

Following Alexander&apos;s conquest of Egypt, the cult of Isis spread across the Mediterranean, with its popularity reaching its zenith in the Roman 
period, when the &quot;goddess of a thousand names&quot; became one of the Mediterranean&apos;s principal deities. It is generally recognized that the 
iconography of Isis nursing Harpokrates influenced Christian representations of the Madonna and Child, particularly the Virgo lactans type 
popular in Medieval Europe.

In the aforementioned article by Giovanni, he cites &quot;parallels for the inscriptions, and linked the coin design to the so-called &apos;Colonna di 
Diocleziano&apos; at the Serapeum in Alexandria. In the new catalog of his collection, Alexandria In Nummis, he states that this important type can 
be linked to Hadrian&apos;s &quot;renovation of the entire area of the Serapeum in Alexandria, which emphasized the transformation into the Pantheon 
of all divinities.&quot; Syncretic gods were to become the norm in Roman Egypt (see Dattari-Savio 7790 for a Zeus-Sarapis pantheistic bust type,

In his book, Giovanni summarizes the unusual reverse type seen on this billon tetradrachm of Hadrian. The image of the Ptah-Sokar-Osiris 
divinity belongs to Egyptian theology, and in particular to funeral worship. It brings together three famous members of the Pharaonic Pantheon 
through their respective symbols: the headdress and scepter for Ptah, the solar disk for Osiris, and the mummiform wrappings for Sokar -the 
&quot;Lord of the Necropolis.&quot; These three associated divinities call upon the concepts of &quot;mourning&quot; and &quot;life&quot;, evoking at the same time the pain 
associated with death and the hope of resurrection. The main sanctuaries of Ptah, Sokaris, and Osiris were at Memphis and Abydos.

(regnal year 15 of Hadrian).

Following Alexander&apos;s conquest of Egypt, the cult of Isis spread across the Mediterranean, with its popularity reaching its zenith in the Roman 
period, when the &quot;goddess of a thousand names&quot; became one of the Mediterranean&apos;s principal deities. It is generally recognized that the 
iconography of Isis nursing Harpokrates influenced Christian representations of the Madonna and Child, particularly the Virgo lactans type 
popular in Medieval Europe.

Rainer Pudill, in his 2014 book Antinoos -Münzen und Medaillen, classifies this type from Hadrian&apos;s regnal year 18 as &quot;pseudo-Antinoos&quot; or 
a &quot;hidden&quot; representation of Antinoüs (see p. 96). Indeed, when Hadrian introduced coinage at Alexandria specifically to honor Antinoüs, he 
is always depicted in the guise of Hermanubis or Hermes.

A wonderful type that depicts two canopic jars. Canopic jars were used to store the organs that were removed from the body during the 
mummification process, specifically the lungs, liver, stomach, and intestines. The term &quot;canopic&quot; to describe such vessels is a misnomer, being 
derived from the port city of Canopus, where the god Osiris was worshipped in the form of a jar.

In Egyptian mythology, Apis is a sacred bull worshipped primarily in Memphis. Identified as the son of Hathor, a primary deity in the 
pantheon of ancient Egypt, he was initially assigned a significant role in her worship, being sacrificed and reborn. Later, Apis also served as 
an intermediary between humans and other powerful deities (first Ptah, later Osiris, then Atum). 

The Apis bull was one of the most important of all the sacred animals in Egypt, and, as with the others, this importance increased as time 
went on. During the colonization of Egypt, Greek and Roman authors had much to say about the Apis bull: the markings by which the black 
calf was recognized, the manner of his conception by a ray from heaven, his house at Memphis with a court for his amusement, the mode of 
prognostication from his actions, his death, the mourning at his death, his costly burial, and the rejoicings throughout the country when a new 
Apis was found. Auguste Mariette&apos;s excavation of the Serapeum of Saqqara revealed the tombs of more than sixty animals, ranging from the 
time of Amenhotep III to that of the Ptolemaic dynasty.

Although there appears to be some confusion over the identity of the deity on the reverse of this extremely rare coin, we agree with Giovanni 
that it is Isis-Euthenia. The authors of RPC describe the figure as Demeter(?), based on a perceived veil, but this &quot;veil&quot; is most likely the result 
of a slight die shift or the coin even being overstruck.

The reverse of this scarce issue depicts Sabina as Demeter on the reverse (or perhaps Isis-Demeter if she is wearing an Isis crown instead 
of a stephane). It is also interesting to note the discrepancy in the spelling of her name between the obverse and reverse (CABINA versus 
CABЄINA), which clearly indicates a lack of consistency amongst the engravers.

The Worship of Antinoüs

Dattari Collection, no. 2087. 

The authors of RPC do not catalogue any coins of Antinoüs for Hadrian&apos;s regnal year 20, preferring to list them all under year 21, but they 
do state that &quot;there is no obvious reason why there should not be any, since year 21 is well attested.&quot; As Antinoüs&apos; coinage from Alexandria 
begins with RY 19, it would make sense that coins were dated for RY 20 also, in addition to RY 21. As there are not any remnants of the letter 
A (for KA = 21) on this coin, Giovanni, just as Dattari before him, dates this coin to Hadrian&apos;s regnal year 20.

($50,000) 

Purchased from Dr. Piero Beretta, Milan, October 1976. Ex Dr. Piero Beretta Collection (Milan); Giovanni Dattari Collection, no. 2089. 

This coin is Giovanni&apos;s favorite coin in his collection, and he used it as the cover coin for his book, Alexandria In Nummis. He also considers 
it the finest known example in private hands. Giovanni purchased this coin from Dr. Piero Beretta (1925-1994), and as he relates in his book, 
it was a &quot;financial sacrifice&quot; in 1976 to purchase this coin from Dr. Beretta, who was a classical art teacher with &quot;exquisite&quot; taste. Dr. Beretta 
was one of the first collectors to have the opportunity to purchase coins from the Dattari collection when it was dispersed, and he was able to 
purchase some of the best and finest pieces in the collection. 

One of the most remarkable cults of the ancient world was that which grew up around the youth Antinoüs, a boy from Claudiopolis in Bithynia 
who attracted the attention of the emperor Hadrian. Hadrian apparently had little love for his wife Sabina, and chose instead to shower favors 
on the handsome youth, whom he apparently chanced upon during a visit to Bithynia. During the emperor&apos;s tour of Egypt in October AD 130, 
Antinoüs fell into the Nile and drowned, an event resulting in suspicions of suicide or ritual murder. The distraught Hadrian had his favorite 
immediately deified, and the worship of Antinoüs became an important facet of the imperial cult. Within a few years, the worship of Antinoüs 
was far larger than the worship of another &quot;cult&quot; figure of the period -Jesus Christ.

Canopic jars were used to store the organs that were removed from the body during the mummification process, specifically the lungs, liver, 
stomach, and intestines. The term &quot;canopic&quot; to describe such vessels is a misnomer, being derived from the port city of Canopus, where the 
god Osiris was worshipped in the form of a jar.

One of the classic rarities and iconic types from the Alexandrian mint. Although identified as being no. 2774 from the Dattari collection, which 
was not plated in his 1901 catalogue, after comparing it to the Dattari-Savio plates it is most likely Dattari 8649. The pencil rubbing of the

Isis Pharia sailing toward the Pharos (lighthouse) of Alexandria is one of the most popular of all the Alexandrian reverse types. Antoninus 
Pius, according to Keith Emmett&apos;s study, struck this type for his regnal years 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 18, and the only year that Emmett did 
not assign at least a rarity of 3 or more to was regnal year 12 (R1).

Giovanni purchased this coin from Dr. Beretta, one of his sources for Dattari coins, and believed it to be Dattari 8583 (and it does share the 
same dies). Dattari 8583 was, however, part of the Dr. Meyer-Coloniensis Collection (Münz Zentrum 64, 15 April 1988, lot 270), and it was 
recently sold again by Dr. Busso Peus Nachf. in their Auction 420, lot 308 (1 November 2017). Most likely, this was another example of this 
rare type that was acquired by Dr. Beretta from another source, and due to sharing the same dies, he thought it to be the Dattari coin.

Sarapis was a syncretic god, combining Hellenistic Greek and Egyptian religious beliefs. His name is of Egyptian origin and derives from a 
synthesis of Ausar (Greek, Osiris), the Egyptian god of the Underworld, and Hapi (Greek, Apis), a manifestation of the god Ptah. Under the 
Ptolemies, Sarapis became the chief tutelary god and the subject of a royally-sponsored cult, whose emphasis on an afterlife made the worship 
of Sarapis one of the more popular mystery cults. His immense popularity soon extended to his creation as Sarapis-Pantheos, a hybrid deity 
incorporating other divine elements. In the case of the present specimen from the Staffieri collection, he is depicted with the radiate crown 
of Helios, his own kalathos, the ram&apos;s horn of Ammon, and the trident of Poseidon entwined with the serpent of Asklepios. In Alexandria, a 
large temple complex, called the Serapeum, was constructed and remained highly patronized well into the fourth century AD. Shortly after the 
imperial decree of AD 391, officially declaring pagan temples closed, the Serapeum was besieged, plundered, and destroyed.

In Egyptian mythology, Apis is a sacred bull worshipped primarily in Memphis. Identified as the son of Hathor, a primary deity in the 
pantheon of ancient Egypt, he was initially assigned a significant role in her worship, being sacrificed and reborn. Later, Apis also served as 
an intermediary between humans and other powerful deities (first Ptah, later Osiris, then Atum). 

The Apis bull was one of the most important of all the sacred animals in Egypt, and, as with the others, this importance increased as time 
went on. During the colonization of Egypt, Greek and Roman authors had much to say about the Apis bull: the markings by which the black 
calf was recognized, the manner of his conception by a ray from heaven, his house at Memphis with a court for his amusement, the mode of 
prognostication from his actions, his death, the mourning at his death, his costly burial, and the rejoicings throughout the country when a new 
Apis was found. Auguste Mariette&apos;s excavation of the Serapeum of Saqqara revealed the tombs of more than sixty animals, ranging from the 
time of Amenhotep III to that of the Ptolemaic dynasty.

The Great Sothic Cycle was a calendrical cycle based on the heliacal rising in July of the star Sirius (known to the Greeks as Sothis) and lasting 
approximately 1460 years. According to ancient Egyptian mythology, in a Golden Age, the beginning of the flooding of the Nile coincided 
exactly with the rising of Sirius, which was reckoned as the New Year. Only once every 1460 years did Sirius rise at exactly the same time. 
Thus, the coincidence of this along with the concurrent beginning of the flooding of the Nile gave the event major cosmological significance 
by heralding not just the beginning of a new year, but the beginning of a new eon. This event also was thought to herald the appearance of the 
phoenix, a mythological bird which was reborn every 500 to 1000 years out of its own ashes. According to one version of the myth, each new 
phoenix embalmed its old ashes in an egg of myrrh, which it then deposited in the Egyptian city of Heliopolis. So important was the advent 
of the new Great Sothic Cycle, both to the realignment of the heavens and its signaling of the annual flooding of the Nile, that the Egyptians 
celebrated it in a five-day festival, which emphasized the important cosmological significance. 

In the third year of the reign of Antoninus Pius (AD 139/40), a new Great Sothic Cycle began. To mark this event, the mint of Alexandria 
struck an extensive series of coinage, especially in large bronze drachms, each related in some astrological way to the reordering of the 
heavens during the advent of the new Great Sothic Cycle. This celebration would continue throughout Pius&apos; reign, with an immense output of 
coinage during the eighth year of his reign in Egypt, which included this coin type, part of the Zodiac series.

Following Alexander&apos;s conquest of Egypt, the cult of Isis spread across the Mediterranean, with its popularity reaching its zenith in the Roman 
period, when the &quot;goddess of a thousand names&quot; became one of the Mediterranean&apos;s principal deities. It is generally recognized that the 
iconography of Isis nursing Harpokrates influenced Christian representations of the Madonna and Child, particularly the Virgo lactans type

This type appears to be rarer than indicated in Emmett, where it is given an &quot;R1&quot; rating. With CoinArchives listing only the specimen we sold 
in our Electronic Auction 397 (17 May 2017), lot 365, it is a rare type in the Alexandrian series, which is skewed by the number in institutional 
collections, hence Emmett&apos;s rating. Of those in private hands, this is certainly one of the finest known. 

A fascinating type related to the Great Sothic Cycle that Giovanni discussed in a 1998 article (G. M. Staffieri, &quot;Isis-Demetra-Sothis nella 
monetazione alessandrina&quot; in Annotazioni Numismatiche, Series II, no. 30 [1998], pp. 693-697).

Ex Künker 89 (8 March 2004), lot 1801. 

An extremely rare type in general, this variant includes a fourth figure, perhaps Isis-Euthenia, not seen on most. The reverse die detail is 
amazing, and the date (not quite clear on the ANS specimen) is visible. 

In his book, Alexandrian Coins, Keith Emmett writes: &quot;It is likely that this coin-type was based on the Eleusinian mysteries of Demeter. 
It represents the symbolic journey of grain (Demeter) from Sarapis&apos; (Hades) underworld to its return above ground under the guidance of 
Fortune (Tyche).&quot; As Emmett was writing about the usually seen variety with three deities, he did not mention the fourth deity, Isis-Euthenia, 
which is seen on the present coin. Isis-Euthenia may have been included by the celator of this particular die as part of this &quot;symbolic journey&quot; 
and to complete the Greco-Roman-Egyptian tetrad.

For his first labor, Herakles was to slay the Nemean Lion and bring back its skin. The Nemean Lion, called thus as it had been terrorizing 
the area around Nemea, had a skin so thick that it was impenetrable to weapons. After making futile attempts to subdue it with his weapons, 
Herakles cast them aside and wrestled the lion to the ground, eventually killing it by thrusting his arm down its throat and choking it to 
death. Skinning the beast was no easy task, either. After Herakles spent hours trying unsuccessfully to skin the lion, Athena, in the guise of 
an old crone, appeared to him, and convinced him to use the creature&apos;s own claws to cut the hide. Thereafter, the hide became the hero&apos;s own 
impenetrable armor. When Eurystheus saw Herakles wearing his new fearsome outfit, he hid in a large bronze jar, and thenceforth commanded 
the hero through a herald.

Herakles standing right, and the Hydra facing left, which was struck for years 8 and 10 (Emmett 1546). 
($3000) 

Ex Paul-Francis Jacquier FPL 29 (Summer 2002), no. 284. 

For his second labor, Herakles had to kill the Lernaean Hydra, the offspring of Typhon and Echidna, and the sibling of the Nemean Lion, the 
Chimaera, and Kerberos. Inhabiting the swamp near Lake Lerna in the Argolid, the creature possessed numerous mortal and one immortal 
head on its single body; should one head be removed, two more would grow in its place. When Herakles reached the swamp where the 
Hydra dwelt, he drew it out of its lair near the spring of Amymone. Thereupon, wielding a harvesting sickle, he attempted to decapitate the 
creature. When this proved unsuccessful, because of the Hydra&apos;s regenerative ability, Herakles enlisted the assistance of his nephew Iolaos, 
who devised a plan: once Herakles had cut off one of the creature&apos;s heads, Iolaos would cauterize the stump with a burning firebrand. The 
plan succeeded, and the Hydra was destroyed. Herakles placed its one immortal head under a large rock on the sacred way between Lerna and 
Elaius and dipped his arrows in its poisonous blood. 

On this rare Alexandrian type, Hydra is anthropomorphized as a giantess, which as been interpreted in the past as &quot;the giantess Echidna 
raising her son Hydra against Herakles in defense.&quot; It remains a mystery as to why the engravers at the Alexandrian mint chose this non-
canonical interpretation for the Lernaean Hydra, especially when other provincial mints that struck coins for the various labors used the more 
traditional representation.

For his third labor, Herakles was required to capture the Cerynean hind, with its brazen hooves and golden horns, alive and bring it from Oenoe 
to Mycenae. Herakles chased the stag for one full year before it finally tired, and then he captured it -as shown on the coin type. This type

The Stymphalian Birds were man-eating birds that had claws of brass, sharp metallic feathers they could launch at their victims, and highly 
toxic dung. Driven to the heavily wooded area around Lake Stymphalia by a pack of wolves, they bred quickly and took over the countryside, 
destroying local crops and fruit trees. They were also favorites of Ares. To complete this Labor, Athena and Hephaestos assisted Herakles by 
forging crotala, or large bronze clappers, by which the birds could be frightened into flight; then, Herakles shot them down with his arrows, 
as depicted on the coin type.

Compelled to capture the Cretan Bull, which had sired the Minotaur, as his seventh Labor, Herakles sailed to Crete. There, Minos the king 
of Crete, gave the hero permission to take the bull away, as it had been causing destruction on the island. Herakles strangled the bull with 
his bare hands, and shipped it back to Athens. Although Eurystheus wished to sacrifice the bull to Hera, the goddess refused the sacrifice

the Marathonian Bull.

The four mares of the giant Diomedes, king of the Bistones in Thrace, had a nightmarish taste for human flesh. It was Herakles&apos; task to steal 
them, and he set about doing so with a cortege including the Lokrian youth Abderos, a beloved of the hero, who in the midst of the story 
is eaten by the horses. Herakles, according to some renderings, was so distraught that he fed Diomedes to his own mares in revenge. The 
Thracian town of Abdera was founded nearby Abderos&apos; grave.

At the request of Admete, Eurystheus&apos; daughter, Herakles as his Ninth Labor went to seize the golden girdle of Hippolyte, a garment that 
gave power and supremacy to the wearer. The daughter of Otrera and the god Ares, Hippolyte was the queen of the Amazons, an all female 
race who lived near the slopes of the Caucasus. To carry off this Labor, Herakles organized an expedition, which included the Athenian hero 
Theseus. Upon the heroes&apos; arrival, the Amazon women greeted them warmly, while Hippolyte offered the girdle as a gift. Hera, on hearing 
this, took the form of an Amazon, spreading a rumor that Herakles had come to steal away their queen, and take her back with him to Greece. 
The female warriors, in protection of their queen, began fighting the heroes. In the melée that followed, Herakles slew Hippolyte, thinking she 
had betrayed him. Winning the battle, Herakles headed back for Mycenae. On the way, he saved the life of Hesione, daughter of Laomedon, 
king of Troy. Laomedon, however, refused to reward the hero for his service. In retribution, Herakles slew the king and all his sons, save the 
youngest, Podarces, who later became known as Priam.

For his tenth labor, Herakles was required to travel to Erytheia to capture the Cattle of Geryon. En route, while crossing the Libyan Desert, 
he became so frustrated at the heat that he shot an arrow at Helios. Admiring the hero&apos;s courage, Helios gave him the golden cup, which 
Helios used to sail nightly across the Ocean from west to east, and Herakles used it to help him reach Erytheia. Upon arriving there, Hercules 
was confronted by the two-headed watchdog, Orthros, and the herdsman Eurytion, each of whom he killed with his club. Hearing what was 
happening, Geryon, armed with three shields, three spears, and wearing three helmets, pursued Herakles to the River Anthemus. Once there, 
Herakles shot Geryon dead with an arrow he had poisoned with the blood of the Lernaean Hydra. To annoy Herakles as he drove the cattle 
back to Eurystheus, Hera sent a gadfly to scatter the herd by biting them. After a year&apos;s labor, Herakles recovered the herd, but was further 
hindered by a flood, also caused by the goddess. Herakles eventually returned to Tiryns, and Eurystheus sacrificed the cattle to Hera.

Because he had been assisted in completing some of his earlier tasks, Herakles was compelled to undergo two more labors. The first of these 
was to steal the Apples of the Hesperides, nymphs who lived in a grove at the far western edge of the world. Herakles tricked the Titan Atlas, 
whose task it was to hold up the heavens, to retrieve the apples in return for holding up the heavens while he did so. Having accomplished the 
task, Atlas was reticent to give up his freedom, and told Herakles that he would take back the apples to Mycenae. Once again, Herakles tricked 
the Titan, requesting that Atlas hold the heavens, while Herakles adjusted his cloak to be more comfortable.

For his twelfth and final labor, Herakles was sent to the underworld to capture Kerberos. In order to complete this most difficult task, Herakles 
was initiated in the Eleusinian Mysteries so that he could learn how to enter and exit the underworld alive, as well as absolve himself of his 
past crime of killing the Centaurs in his fourth Labor. Finding the entrance to the underworld, he again enlisted the assistance of Athena, 
while Hermes, the conveyor of souls, guided him along. While there, Herakles was able to free Theseus, who had been imprisoned by Hades 
for attempting to kidnap Persephone, but could not do the same for Theseus&apos; accomplice, Pirithous. Herakles sought the permission of Hades 
and Persephone to take Kerberos. The gods assented on condition that Herakles did not harm the creature in any way. Wrestling Kerberos 
into submission, he brought it to the upper world through an entrance in the Peloponnese. When he returned with Kerberos to the palace, 
Eurystheus was so afraid of the fearsome beast that he jumped into a large storage jar to hide (a common theme throughout the labors, always 
depicting King Eurystheus as a coward). With this, Herakles&apos; punishment was complete, and he was now freed of his guilt.

Herakles, on his way to capture the Erymanthian boar, was entertained by the Centaur Pholos, who offered Herakles wine from the centaur&apos;s 
communal wine jar. This angered the other centaurs and they attacked Herakles while Pholos hid in terror. In Herakles&apos; attempt to defeat the 
centaurs, an arrow inadvertently struck the Centaur Chiron -Herakles&apos; old friend and tutor. Herakles tried to help Chiron, but to no avail as the 
wound was incurable. The Alexandrian coin type portrays Herakles, holding a lyre, and clasping the arm of Pholos as the two are conversing; 
to the right, an attendant is drawing wine from the communal jar.

The Judgment of Paris, a mythical &quot;beauty contest&quot; of sorts, serves as a prelude to the Trojan War. Eris, goddess of discord, was excluded from 
a feast thrown by Zeus, but the scorned deity arrived uninvited with a golden apple inscribed &quot;for the fairest.&quot; Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite 
each claimed the apple, and Zeus was asked to award it to the most beautiful. Zeus, wishing to avoid this uncomfortable situation, appointed 
the mortal Paris as judge, as the shepherd and prince of Troy had a reputation for his fairness. Each goddess attempted to sway Paris with a 
bribe in order to win the apple: Athena offered him incredible skill in battle, Hera offered him an immense kingdom, and Aphrodite offered 
him the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen of Sparta, the wife of the Greek king Menelaus. Paris could not refuse Aphrodite&apos;s offer, 
setting in motion the war between the Greeks and Trojans.

Hades fell in love with Persephone, the daughter of Demeter, and asked Zeus for permission to marry her. Fearing to offend his eldest 
brother by a downright refusal, but also knowing that Demeter would not forgive him if Persephone were committed to the underworld, Zeus 
diplomatically answered that he could neither give nor withhold his consent. This act emboldened Hades to abduct Persephone as she was 
picking flowers in a meadow and carry her away in his horse-drawn chariot to the underworld.

&quot;The wise and benevolent centaur Chiron, as tutor and guide, was given the custody of the sons of many ancient princes&quot; and heroes (including

Orpheus, the son of the Thracian king Oiagros and the Muse Kalliope, was a master poet, proficient on the lyre, and possessing a melodious 
voice surpassed by no other mortal. He mesmerized gods and mortals alike with his song. His musical powers were so intense that the birds 
and animals, even trees and stones, were charmed and drew near to hear his voice. Orpheus married the nymph Eurydike, but their life together 
was cut short by the bite of a snake that sent Eurydike from the land of the living to the shadowy kingdom of the underworld. Distraught over 
the death of his beloved, Orpheus descended into the land of shades and made his way to the very throne of Hades and his queen Persephone. 
His music was so enticing that all the inhabitants of the underworld were entranced, and the King of Darkness granted Orpheus&apos; request to 
return Eurydike to the light of day provided he dare not look back at her until they both had cleared the gates of Hades. The temptation was too 
great, though, and Orpheus turned to gaze upon Eurydike for the last time before her spirit sped back to the underworld. Totally disheartened 
by his second loss, Orpheus shunned all women and sang his songs in the company of Thracian men, who became distracted from their 
womenfolk. Outraged, the Thracian women ultimately fell on Orpheus and killed him. Severing his head from his body, they cast it into the 
Hebrus River, where it floated on his lyre, still singing, out to sea. Finally, Orpheus&apos; head drifted to Lesbos, where it was enshrined by the 
nymphs.

A rather obscure myth, in one version King Lykurgos is credited with defeating the army of Dionysos when the god invaded Thrace. Dionysos 
escaped by plunging into the sea and sought refuge in Thetis&apos; grotto. Dionysos&apos; mother, Rhea, upset by her son&apos;s misfortune, drove Lykurgos 
mad and then helped her son&apos;s army to escape. Lykurgos, in his madness, killed his own son Dryas with an axe (believing he was cutting down 
a vine, hence the coin type), and then pruned the corpse of its nose, ears, fingers, and toes. Dionysos, returning from the sea, told the people 
of Thrace that Lykurgos would have to be killed or the land would remain barren as punishment for Lykurgos&apos; crime. King Lykurgos was then 
killed by being drawn and quartered by wild horses.

Perseus, the slayer of Medusa, was returning from this task, when he caught sight of a naked woman chained to a sea-cliff, and instantly fell 
in love with her. This was the princess Andromeda, daughter of King Kepheus of Joppa and Kassiopeia. Kassiopeia had boasted that both she 
and Andromeda were more beautiful than the Nereids, who then complained about this insult to their protector, Poseidon. Poseidon sent a 
flood and a female sea-monster to devastate Philistia (Palestine) -the home of Kassiopeia and Andromeda. 

When the king consulted an oracle, he was told that his only hope was to sacrifice Andromeda to the sea-monster. This was Andromeda&apos;s 
predictament when Perseus happened upon her. Perseus killed the sea-monster and took Andromeda as his wife, but only after using Medusa&apos;s 
head to turn Kassiopeia and Kepheus to stone after they broke their bargain with him for saving their daughter. The coin type depicts Perseus 
helping Andromeda down from the sea-cliff.

The Nilometer, in this case a stone stele that measured the inundation of the Nile, was a prominent landmark in Egyptian culture. It was vital 
as a calendar to mark the passing of the seasons and for assessing the fertility of the land, which depended on the annual Nile flood. It occurs 
frequently in Egyptian art, surrounded by attendants and the fruits of the fertile river.

Ex Historical Coin Review (Victor England) Vol. XIII, No. 7 (September 1988), no. 30. 

Sarapis was a syncretic god, combining Hellenistic Greek and Egyptian religious beliefs. His name is of Egyptian origin and derives from a 
synthesis of Ausar (Greek, Osiris), the Egyptian god of the Underworld, and Hapi (Greek, Apis), a manifestation of the god Ptah. Under the 
Ptolemies, Sarapis became the chief tutelary god and the subject of a royally-sponsored cult, whose emphasis on an afterlife made the worship 
of Sarapis one of the more popular mystery cults. His immense popularity soon extended to his creation as Sarapis-Pantheos, a hybrid deity 
incorporating other divine elements. In the case of the present specimen from the Staffieri collection, he is depicted with the radiate crown of 
Helios, his own kalathos, the ram&apos;s horn of Ammon, and the serpent staff of Asklepios.

Emmett lists this diobol type for two regnal years for Faustina Junior -years 3 and 4. For year 3, he cites the Dattari coin (no. 9387), and for 
year 4 he cites Milne 2504a, which is in the Ashmolean Museum, but the date is not visible, and Milne was guessing that it is year 4. The type 
also exists with Agathodaimon on horseback left, Dattari 3637, which is not photographed in the 1901 catalogue of Dattari&apos;s collection, nor the 
Dattari-Savio plates, and therefore can not be verified. As to the meaning of the reverse type, the horse represents the changing of the seasons, 
whereas the serpent represents regeneration or the rebirth of the crops. All of Egyptian life was dependent on this cycle.

A wonderful Julia Domna tetradrachm issued under her son, Caracalla. The reverse is identified as Ares by Dattari, et al, based most likely on 
a Corinthian helmet they perceive him to be wearing. Without another example to compare it to, this cataloguer believes that it is Caracalla,

The Nilometer, in this case a stone obelisk that measured the inundation of the Nile, was a prominent landmark in Egyptian culture. It was vital 
as a calendar to mark the passing of the seasons and for assessing the fertility of the land, which depended on the annual Nile flood. It occurs 
frequently in Egyptian art, surrounded by attendants and the fruits of the fertile river.

It is difficult where to place this obverse die, which seems to be the result of some confusion. It could be either the earliest die for Gordian as 
Caesar, in which case the engraver gave him the wrong imperial title, or the earliest die as Augustus, albeit with a continuation of the use of 
the bare head for the Caesar issues (the legend shows no signs of being re-engraved over an earlier legend). In either case, the name is clearly 
blundered, and a first issue as Caesar would seem a more logical time for such an error to occur.

As described above, there are possibly only three known specimens for this extremely rare reverse type of Philip I. It is possible that this coin 
is also the Col. Curtis coin, but in his book, he describes the reverse as &quot;Nilus seated &amp; Euthenia standing; Nilus to l., holds cornucopia &amp; reed, 
crocodile by side; Euthenia to r., holds wreath in r. hand; in ex. L ∆ (unpublished type).&quot; The key difference is the &quot;crocodile by side,&quot; which 
if correct, then it is not the same coin, nor for the sake of accuracy, the same type. It is also possible that Curtis just erred in his description, 
using the ubiquitous crocodile versus the lesser seen hippopotamus when describing this coin type.

Sarapis was a syncretic god, combining Hellenistic Greek and Egyptian religious beliefs. His name is of Egyptian origin and derives from a 
synthesis of Ausar (Greek, Osiris), the Egyptian god of the Underworld, and Hapi (Greek, Apis), a manifestation of the god Ptah. Under the 
Ptolemies, Sarapis became the chief tutelary god and the subject of a royally-sponsored cult, whose emphasis on an afterlife made the worship 
of Sarapis one of the more popular mystery cults. His immense popularity soon extended to his creation as Sarapis-Pantheos, a hybrid deity 
incorporating other divine elements. In the case of the present specimen from the Staffieri collection, he is depicted with the radiate crown 
of Helios, his own kalathos, the ram&apos;s horn of Ammon, the cornucopia of Nilus, and the trident of Poseidon entwined with the serpent of 
Asklepios.

Saloninus survived his brother by another two years. Afer the death of Valerian II, Saloninus was given the rank of Caesar, and sent to Cologne 
to oversee the western provinces. He was aided by Silvanus, the praetorian prefect, and Postumus, the governor of Upper (or Lower) Germany. 
But soon Postumus was hailed as emperor by his troops, and he laid siege to the town of Cologne and the site of Saloninus&apos; court. After 
holding the rank of Augustus for a very brief period, the unfortunate Saloninus was executed by Postumus, along with Silvanus. Postumus 
then constructed a triumphal arch commemorating his victory over the teenage emperor.

Achilles Tatius&apos; description of the cult image of Harpokrates of Pelousion, given in his tale of the adventures of the lovers Klitophon and 
Leukippe, is frustratingly brief and offers no clue as to how the youthful deity became associated with Zeus. Coins and gems serve as the 
primary evidence for the iconography of the sanctuary&apos;s cult statue.

Quintillus was the younger brother of Claudius II, and had been placed in command by his brother at Aquileia to protect the western borders, 
while Claudius was in command of the effort against the Goths. In August or September of 270, when news reached Italy and Aquileia of 
Claudius&apos; death, Quintillus paid a donative to the army, curried the support of the Senate, and was then hailed emperor. His tenure was to 
be short-lived as the Illyrian troops proclaimed Aurelian, Claudius&apos; successor in the Gothic campaign in the Balkans, as emperor. In either 
October or November of 270, Quintillus committed suicide, after his own soldiers had abandoned his cause.

A fascinating coin that has been overstruck on another provincial bronze. As this was either a new denomination being introduced, or the 
bronze drachm being reintroduced on a reduced standard, it is possible that the Alexandrian mint used other provincial bronzes as the flans for 
this rare issue, which would help explain the inconsistency of the diameters and weights of surviving examples. A study of extant examples 
might help determine if other specimens exhibit any signs of an undertype. In any case, an overstruck Alexandrian coin of any type or period 
is basically never encountered.

While a nominal ally of Rome, Odenathus, ruler of the wealthy eastern trade center of Palmyra and husband of Septimia Zenobia, took 
advantage of Rome&apos;s internal and external conflicts to expand his territories. The circumstances surrounding the assassination of Odenathus 
around 267 are uncertain, but we do know that Zenobia soon after took the title of Augusta and bestowed on her infant son Vaballathus the 
title of Augustus. Zenobia continued to expand the Palmyrene kingdom, seizing control of Egypt in 269 and, with it, the Roman grain supply. 
To further bolster her position, Zenobia claimed to be the descendant of such illustrious figures as Cleopatra VII of Egypt and the legendary 
Queen Dido of Carthage. 

When Aurelian rose to the purple in 270, he pragmatically acquiesced to Zenobia and Vaballathus&apos; rule in the east, while he concerned himself 
with stabilizing the situation in the west. By 272, he was prepared to campaign against the usurpers. Palmyra was sacked, and both Zenobia 
and Vabalathus were captured as they tried to make their way to Persia. Zenobia was brought to Rome and paraded in Aurelian&apos;s triumph in 
274. According to a later tradition, Aurelian, impressed by her beauty and dignity, later freed her and granted her a villa in Tibur, where she 
spent the rest of her life.

In his book, Giovanni has identified the bust on the reverse of this coin as Roma. This cataloguer understands the logic of this identification, 
but I still prefer my original attribution of the bust to Galerius. 

Giovanni also indicates that this coin may possibly be from the Col. James W. Curtis collection, as he cites a similar coin in his book as 
X-2125. The X before the collection number actually indicates that the coin was not owned by Curtis, and also, Curtis is describing Dattari 
6110, with the type facing right, and without a spear.

The revolt of Domitius Domitianus in Egypt destabilized a vitally strategic region by interrupting the grain supply to Rome and opening the 
possibility of a Persian (Sasanian) invasion. For almost a year, Domitius Domitianus controlled Alexandria and its mint, striking aurei and 
folles, as well as a series of pre-reform provincial denominations. 

A major question regarding these latter coins has been what were their specific values. For the most part, scholars agree that the larger coins 
featuring the radiate bust must be a double, and thereby call it an octodrachm. At half the weight, then, the smallest coins with the Nike on 
the reverse must be tetradrachms, though these coins have erroneously been called heretofore didrachms. The weights of these tetradrachms 
appear consistent with the final issues of pre-reform tetradrachms of the Tetrarchs. The middle denomination poses the largest challenge to 
this arrangement. By weight, it should be a hexadrachm. However, no such denomination was known to have been struck in Egypt, though 
tetradrachms earlier in the third century achieved this weight. The obvious problem here would be the confusion caused in circulating the 
same denomination in two different weights. As this type is the rarest of the group, it is possible that it was meant for a special occasion, or 
more remotely, a stalled attempt to reinstitute the pre-reform coinage on an earlier weight standard. Further investigation may shed more light 
on this subject.

Because of the reverse, this tetradrachm has been erroneously attributed as an issue related to the Festival of Isis coinage. Alföldi, in his work 
on the subject, demonstrated that all the Festival of Isis coinage was of imperial type, minted at Rome in the later fourth century AD, and 
conformed to a standardized legend and type -VOTA PVBLICA and the goddess standing on her divine ship. Since he listed no provincial 
issues commemorating the festival, and since the striking of provincial coinage had ended by the beginning of the fourth century, it is 
reasonable to conclude that this tetradrachm, while it does depict Isis, is not to be associated with the festival in Rome. 

In any event, this type is very rare, and some extremely rare Alexandrian coins may offer a clue for its use under Diocletian. Egypt was 
undergoing a number of economic changes as the Roman government was beginning to end the production of its provincial coinage and 
replacing it with imperial types. During this transition, while the mint was striking tetradrachms of a more imperial style with increasingly 
imperial types, very rare undated issues, some with specifically Egyptian reverses, such as this coin, were also struck. Most likely, these latter 
coins were an attempt to ease the changes taking place and accommodate a population used to its local monetary types. Ultimately, this policy 
failed to satisfy, for shortly after the new imperial coinage was introduced, a revolt in Egypt broke out under Domitius Domitianus.

At almost two grams lighter than the tetradrachms in this series, Giovanni considers this coin either a reduced-weight tetradrachm or a 
didrachm. In practice, with the same types as the full-weight tetradrachms, a reduced weight tetradrachm (or didrachm) would be very 
confusing for the local population. But as these coins do not fit into the normal Alexandrian coinage, as they do not have regnal dates, it is also 
possible that not as much attention was paid to weight standards, or we just don&apos;t understand the intended use for these coins (e.g. they may be 
part of the &apos;pattern&apos; issues that were developed during the transition from the Alexandrian to the Imperial series as noted before).

the transitional period between the strictly Alexandrian-style coinage and the introduction of the new Roman-style coinage (e.g. folles, etc.).
