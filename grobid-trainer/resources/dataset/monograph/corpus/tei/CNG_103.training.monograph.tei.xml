AUCTION TERMS 

All written, fax, email and phone bids must be received by 5PM (ET) September 13, 2016. 

The Electronic Close starts at 10AM ET on September 14, 2016. Lots close every 15 seconds. 

To participate in this sale electronically you must be registered and approved to bid on www.cngcoins.com. 

Please read the auction terms for new information regarding bidding, buyer&apos;s fees, and payment of invoices. 

This is an internet and mail bid sale with an automated electronic close, con-
ducted by Classical Numismatic Group, Inc. (CNG). Bidding in the auction 
constitutes acceptance of the following terms: 

1. The property listed in this catalogue is offered for sale by CNG for itself 
and as agent for various owners and other consignors. We reserve the right 
to reject any bid, to determine the opening price, to set bidding increments, 
to vary the order of the auction, to reopen bidding in the case of a dispute, to 
withdraw any lot, to bid on behalf of CNG, to bid on behalf of the consignor, 
and to permit the consignor to bid on his own lots. CNG may loan or advance 
money to consignors or prospective bidders, and may have an interest other 
than commission charges in any lot. CNG may bid on its own account as an 
&quot;insider&quot; with information not available to the public. 

2. Lots will be sold in the order listed in the catalogue. The first lot will 
close electronically at www.cngcoins.com at 9AM Eastern Time on the sale 
date, with subsequent lots closing every 15 seconds thereafter. All written, 
fax, email and phone bids must be received by 5PM Eastern Time, on the day 
prior to the sale date. Electronic bids may be placed by approved bidders up 
until the closing time of each lot. The electronic clock on the website represents 
the official closing time for each lot. Bidders intending to bid electronically 
must first register at www.cngcoins.com. New website registrations are pro-
cessed for approval Monday through Friday 9AM-5PM Eastern Time only. No 
new registrations will be approved on the sale date. 

3. A 21% Buyer&apos;s Fee will be added to the hammer price of all successful 
written, fax, email and phone bids. A 19% Buyer&apos;s Fee will be added to the 
hammer price of all successful electronic bids directly placed on www.cng-
coins.com. 

4. All coins are guaranteed genuine. Attribution, date, condition and other 
descriptions are the opinion of the cataloguer, and no warranty is expressed 
or implied. Please note that an auction sale is not an approval sale. Lots 
examined prior to the sale and lots purchased by floor bidders (including bid-
ders executing commission bids on behalf of other parties) may not be returned 
for any reason except lack of authenticity. All claims of misdescription and all 
claims of return, except claims regarding authenticity, must be made within 5 
days of receipt of material. Any claim of lack of authenticity must be made 
in writing by the original purchaser immediately after discovery that an item 
is not authentic, and upon making such a claim the original purchaser must 
immediately return the lot to CNG in the same condition as at the time of the 
auction. Coins that have been encapsulated (&quot;slabbed&quot;) by a grading and/or 
authentication service may not be returned for any reason, including authen-
ticity, if they have been removed from the encapsulation (&quot;slab&quot;). If payment 
is made by credit card, rights of return are governed by these Auction Terms 
which supercede any rights of return promulgated by the card issuer. Estimates 
are intended as a guide only and not as a statement of opinion of value. 

5. Invoices are due and payable immediately upon receipt. Interest and late 
fees of 2.0% per month, or at the highest rate permitted by law, whichever 
is less, from the date of the auction, shall be payable on invoices not settled 
within 30 days of the auction date. Payment may be made by check or bank 
wire. Credit cards (Visa or MasterCard) will be accepted; credit card payments 
will not be accepted more than 14 days after the sale date. Payment by check 
must be made in either US dollars ($) drawn on a US bank or British sterling 
(£) drawn on a British bank. All successful bidders outside North America and 
the United Kingdom will be charged an additional $20 fee for bank charges 
that are the result of international wire transfer fees; this fee will be deducted 
for credit card or check payment as described above. CNG may reduce or 
compromise any charge or fee at its discretion. 

6. Bidders not known to us must provide satisfactory credit references or 
pay a deposit as determined at CNG&apos;s discretion before bidding. Minors are 
not permitted to bid without written consent of a parent guaranteeing payment. 
CNG may require payment in full from any bidder prior to delivery of lots. 
Title does not pass until lots are paid in full. Upon receipt of lots, the buyer 
assumes full responsibility for loss or damage. Delivery to the buyer&apos;s address 
of record shall constitute receipt by the buyer regardless of the identity of the 
person accepting delivery. 

7. Estimates are in U.S. dollars ($) and bids must be made in even dollar 
($) amounts. The CNG website, www.cngcoins.com, will execute electronic 
bids on behalf of all electronic bidders. Subject to reserves and opening prices, 
all electronic bids will be executed by the electronic software at one bidding 
increment (approximately 10%) over the next highest bid. All written, fax, 
email and phone bids received before 5PM the day prior to the sale date will be 
uploaded to the CNG website no later than the day prior to the sale date. These 
bids will not be subject to the minimum required bid cited on the website at 
the time of the upload. Any written, fax, email and phone bids received after 
the deadline or with special instructions will be executed at CNG&apos;s complete 
discretion and will be subject to the next bid required by the website. In the 
case of identical written, fax, email and phone bids, the earliest bid received 
wins. An electronic bid has priority over any identical written, fax, email or 
phone bid. Bid by lot number. No lot will be broken. Bidders are responsible 
for errors in bidding. Check your bids carefully. Electronic bidders may check 
their bids under User Services at www.cngcoins.com. 

8. A word on Reserves. CNG may place a reserve on any lot. However, no 
reserve will be higher than the estimate, and ordinarily lots are reserved at 60% 
of estimate. 

9. Bidders personally guarantee payment for their successful bids, including 
bidders executing commission bids from other parties and bidders representing 
corporations or other entities. Buyers accepting commission bids from other 
parties do so at their own risk and remain responsible for payment under these 
Auction Terms. 

10. In the event a successful bidder fails to make full payment within 30 
days of the auction date, CNG reserves the right to deem the sale incomplete 
and to resell the material, and the bidder agrees to pay for the reasonable cost 
of such a sale and also to pay any difference between the resale price and the 
previously successful bid. CNG reserves all rights that it is entitled to under 
the Pennsylvania Uniform Commercial Code, including the right to offset any 
sums due from a successful bidder against any future consignment or purchase 
or monies or goods in possession of CNG. 

11. Sales tax, postage, handling and insurance are the responsibility of the 
buyer and are added to all invoices where appropriate. For buyers in the 
European Union, CNG may import lots into the United Kingdom prior to 
shipment and charge buyers the import Value Added Tax. On any tax not paid 
by the purchaser which should have been paid, even if not invoiced by CNG, 
the purchaser agrees to pay the same on demand together with any interest or 
penalty that may be assessed. It is the responsibility of the buyer to comply 
with foreign customs and other regulations. 

12. Prices realized are published and are mailed with CNG&apos;s next publica-
tion. Prices realized are posted at www.cngcoins.com and successful electronic 
bidders are notified by email after the last lot of the sale closes. 

13. Bidders hereby waive any claim for incidental, consequential or exem-
plary damages arising from this auction. The sole remedy that any participant 
in the auction shall have for any claim or controversy arising out of the auction 
shall be a refund, without interest, of all or part of the purchase price paid by 
the participant. 

14. All rights granted by CNG or otherwise available to bidders and pur-
chasers, under these Auction Terms or otherwise, are personal and may not 
be assigned or transferred to any other person or entity, whether by operation 
of law or otherwise. No third party may rely on any benefit or right conferred 
by these Auction Terms. Bidders acting as agents must disclose the agency in 
writing to CNG prior to the auction; otherwise rights are limited to the agent 
and are not transferable to the undisclosed principal. 

15. Any dispute regarding this auction shall be governed by the laws of 
Pennsylvania and shall be adjudicated only by the Lancaster County Court 
of Common Pleas or the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of 
Pennsylvania; all bidders submit themselves to the personal jurisdiction of 
these courts for this purpose, consent to service of process by registered or 
certified mail, and waive any contrary provisions of Articles 14 or 15 of the 
French Civil Code and any similar provisions in any jurisdiction. All bidders 
consent to the confidentiality of consignors&apos; identities and waive any right to 
require disclosure of the name of the consignor or owner of any auction lot, 
whether such right is based on New York GOL  §5-701(a) or any other provi-
sion in any jurisdiction. In any dispute regarding this auction, the prevailing 
party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorney fees.

is rendered in exquisite detail with the added novelty of his helmet being decorated with Skylla hurling a stone, the very embodiment of 
aggressive violence before the enemy in time of war.

The settlement of Borysthenes off the northern coast of the Black Sea is one of the earliest Greek settlements in the region of Skythia. Bronze 
arrowhead money is well attested from this site, but recently electrum staters and trites (Anokin 150 and 151) have been published that are 
thought to originate there, perhaps as a consequence of trade with the Greek cities of northwest Asia minor. 

In his article on the 2002 Ingot Hoard, Kim noted four struck coins that were included in the hoard, two staters of the present type and two 
trites as in the following lot. While generally skeptical of the hoard in general, Kim notes that the ingots could be of ancient manufacture, but 
based on their low gold content, the ingots must have been made not earlier than the 5th or 4th centuries BC. As for the coins, Kim concluded 
that these were likely modern forgeries, partially due to his skepticism over their general style and fabric, but mostly based on their metallurgy, 
which he thought should comport with the contemporary electrum at Kyzikos, Mytilene, and Phokaia, cities in the region that were still using 
electrum coinage as late as the 4th century BC. Recognizing that the coins were metallurgically compatible with the ingots, rather than the 
coins from these cities, he suggests that a modern forger probably made the coins from the ingots to increase the value of the hoard. 

We would propose a different interpretation. The differences in style and fabric that he noted are not dispositive; these coins are products of a 
mint that previously had only been known to produce bronze coins and proto-coinage, one that is also at a geographically significant distance 
from other mints producing electrum. Thus, these differences could easily be explained by the coins being a novel production at a mint not 
well versed in electrum production, and the types likely had a local context, one which is not readily apparent to us today. 

Kim&apos;s metallurgic reasons for doubting the coins are also not dispositive. We know that the metal content of electrum varied in different 
regions and over time. As noted above, the hoard is from a region that is geographically distant from the cities whose electrum coinage Kim 
compared it to. We also are uncertain of the date of the deposit of the hoard. Moreover, we know virtually nothing of the circulation pattern of 
any electrum coins issued from Borysthenes, such that a metrologic incompatibility with coins from Kyzikos, Mytilene, and Phokaia would 
not be unusual even if they were contemporary. It is therefore not unreasonable that the metal content of the electrum coins in this hoard are 
not an exact match with coins of a certain time frame from mints located in disparate regions around the Black Sea. 

In sum, there is very little that we know about the context of the hoard. These coins could even predate the trade of electrum coins across 
the Black Sea, and could have been intended for some other use where the types and metal content would not be inconsistent with normal 
commerce. Other than their novel appearance, there is very little to contradict accepting the coins as the product of an ancient mint. The fact 
that in the interim since Kim&apos;s article more of these coins have come to light, and they have been accepted as genuine by V. A. Anokhin, a 
scholar who is intimately knowledgeable with coins from this region, should give us confidence.

Petac &amp; Vilcu date these staters to the Third Syrian War (246-241 BC), but the evidence supporting their theory is not secure. On the contrary, 
the numerous Alexander-type issues that share control marks with these Lysimachi are securely dated to the late-third century by multiple

This coin is a very high quality imitation that would likely pass for an official issue. It&apos;s true origin is only betrayed by the unusual obverse 
style that is aberrant for Sidon and the minor errors in Philip&apos;s name. The deeply concave reverse suggests a mint in the east, perhaps in Persis.

There are times when some of us wonder what the world would be like today if Alexander the Great had lived to a ripe old age. The same kind 
of &quot;What if...&quot; thinking could be applied to Epaminondas. His premature death on the battlefield of Mantineia in 362 BC deprived Thebes of 
its greatest statesman and soldier, signalling the start of Thebes&apos; rapid decline into obscurity. If Epaminondas had lived to reap the benefits of 
his Mantineian victory, he would have undoubtedly proceeded to unite all Greece under his leadership. The next step would be to turn to the 
North and face Philip who, instead of finding a divided Greece ready for the taking, would think twice before attempting to invade Thessaly. 
Whether then there would be a clash between the two emerging superpowers or a truce between them, is anybody&apos;s guess. Perhaps Philip 
would remember the years he spent as a hostage in Thebes and his respect for the Theban statesman would prevail. The conquest of Asia would 
then materialize sooner and in a more permanent manner. But, like many great soldiers, Epaminondas inspired his men by leading them into 
battle and, instead of capitalizing on his genius, Thebes paid the price for his bravery.

The particular style of the palmette on Athena&apos;s helmet, and the narrow, deep incuse of the reverse suggests that this coin was among the 
earliest issues in the ubiquitous &quot;fontal eye&quot;/classical tetradrachms of the mid-late 5th century at Athens, as these feature more closely 
represent that found on the early-mid 5th century issues (&quot;Starr groups&quot;).

This coin is from a massive issue that was struck in an apparently hasty manner, as indicated by the relatively crude dies that were often 
overused. Many of the known examples are poorly struck, another indication of haste. The date of the issue, in the mid-30s BC, suggests that 
the issue was made in conjunction with Mark Antony&apos;s preparations for his incipient war with Octavian. The head of Aphrodite may also 
have the features of Cleopatra VII, as many issues in the region at this time used her likeness in an attempt to flatter the wealthy queen (in fact, 
another issue of Patrai, BCD Peloponnesos 531, was actually struck in the name of Cleopatra).

from an unrelated mint.

This interesting issue of electrum staters has been known for some time. Noting the similarity of the reverse punches to electrum staters at 
Miletos with a recumbent lion, Kraay suggested it may have been one of many issues from the early period at that city with this form of punch 
marks, perhaps the earliest, with the city using varying types before settling on a lion as its civic badge. Nevertheless, Kraay also noted that 
some issues with this form of punchmarking had been attributed to cities in Caria and Lydia, so the identification of the mint as Miletos was 
speculative. 

Until more recent discoveries, though, the subsidiary symbols on the obverse, a flower (lotus?) and rosette, were either not clearly visible or 
missed by catalogers. Although the configuration and style of the reverse punches suggests a date contemporary to the lion staters of Miletos, 
the appearance of these symbols casts doubt on such an early chronology, as subsidiary symbols do not commonly appear on electrum until 
much later. Subsidiary symbols on electrum staters are more common on northwest Anatolian issues of the early 5th century BC. The most 
prominent examples are the various electrum staters typically given to the time of the Ionian Revolt (cf. ACGC 74), and the early issues at 
Lampsakos (cf. Kraay &amp; Hirmer 727). A lotus symbol is also found as a subsidiary symbol on electrum staters that may have been issued in 
Thrace in the late 6th century (cf. Rosen 148-9). Another example is the recently discovered staters featuring a lion lying right with a lotus 
flower above (cf. Linzalone 1174), typically dated to the early 5th century. Interestingly, this issue has a similar configuration of reverse 
punches, though they have a more uniform appearance that suggests a date later than the present specimen. The closest parallel with the 
current stater issue, however, is a stater with a lion lying left with lotus flower above (cf. Rosen 245). The reverse of this issue also has a 
similar configuration of punches, but appears closer to our piece in style. Unfortunately, that issue is known from just one example, and its 
date of issue is unknown. 

Another factor to consider is the combination of rosette and lotus symbols. These two symbols frequently occur together, particularly on silver 
issues from cities in the region of northern Greece during the period that they were under Persian rule. Both the rosette and lotus are often 
found in Persian art. At Persepolis, rosettes of the same form as found on this stater adorn a chariot on the north face of the Apadana, they 
adorn the bridle of a bull fighting a lion, and frame the scene on the stairway façade of Palace H, and can be seen on parts of the façade of 
Palace G (now moved to Palace H). In Persian art, the rosette is often used to depict a lotus seen from above, and the same Palace G façade 
also features a column of lotus blossums above the rosettes. E. Herzfeld&apos;s drawings from Persepolis often depict the lotus and rosette used 
in conjunction (see, e.g., Drawing, &quot;Excavation of Persepolis [Iran]: Apadana, East Side, Ceremonial Staircases: Carvings of Palms,&quot; 1905-
1934, FSA A.6 05.0899, Ernst Herzfeld Papers, Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery Archives, Smithsonian Institution). Thus, 
the rosette and lotus have long connections in Persian art, and are often found in conjunction. Their use is also attested in ancient Egyptian art, 
but the importation of the symbols on coins in Asia Minor are more likely a result of Persian influence. 

It seems thus that this coin was issued after the Persians conquered western Asia Minor in the mid 6th century, but probably not much later, as the 
configuration and style of the reverse punches seem closely related to the early staters of Miletos. But what of the interpretation of the design? 
The rosette and lotus symbols are likely to be interpreted as one, rather than two separate images, simply depicting the flower from the side and 
above. Their meaning in Persian art is manifold: divinity, light, heaven, or royal authority are often suggested. More perplexing is the primary 
type, the forepart of a horse. Like the rosette and lotus, horse protomes are well known from Persepolis, particularly as capitals. In essence, the 
design in total, horse forepart with lotus and rosette, can be viewed as intrinsically Persian, and probably is symbolic of Persian authority.

The &apos;Kroisos&apos; type coinage is one of the most recognizable of all ancient Greek coinage. All of the issues in the bimetallic, gold and silver, 
series feature the same confronted lion and bull foreparts on the obverse, and two incuse punches (or a single punch in the case of small 
denominations) on the reverse. It is thought that the series began on a &apos;heavy&apos; standard, with gold and silver staters of equal weight, around 
10.6-10.7 grams, which was later reduced to about 8.17 grams for the gold. More recently, though, studies have shown that coins of both 
standards circulated together, but that the heavy standard was only used for a relatively short time compared to the light standard, which 
continued to be used into the Persian period. The Kroiseids have also traditionally been broken down into two stylistic groups, &apos;realistic&apos; and 
&apos;stylized&apos;, with hoard evidence suggesting that the former belonged to the time of Kroisos, while the latter were of the time of the Persians. 
The present coin, however, is from an issue that constitutes a third group that has a more archaic style, which has features that suggest it is the 
first issue of Kroisos&apos; bimetallic coinage. 

This prototype issue was first noted and analyzed in an article by Paolo Naster in 1964 (&quot;Une série aberrante de Créséides&quot; in BSFN 19 
(1964), pp. 364-5, reprinted in P. Naster, Scripta Nummaria: Contributions à la méthodologie numismatique [Louvian-la-Neuve, 1983], pp. 
76-7). The archaic character of the type is most evident in the bull, where the fine waves of hair on the later coinage is here represented as 
a series of pelleted lines emanating from a solid arc that forms the animal&apos;s neckline. At the same time, antecedents of the style of the lion 
can be seen in the earlier electum coinage, particularly the hemihektai of Wiedauer&apos;s Group XVI. The most significant feature linking this 
issue to the electrum, though, is the appearance of the small pellet or protuberance on the head of the lion. This feature, usually featuring rays 
emanating from it, is canonical on all the earlier electrum coinage from the time of Ardys until the early part of Kroisos&apos; reign. It is a feature 
that is totally lacking on the bimetallic coinage of the &apos;realistic&apos; and, later, &apos;stylized&apos; character. A final unusual feature particular to this issue 
is the depiction of the arms of the lion and bull, which are shown bent nearly 90 degrees at their mid-point, rather than in a straight line from 
shoulder to paw and hoof. 

The extreme rarity today of these early style staters also suggests that the issue was short-lived, perhaps a trial run before the style was 
standardized. Martin Price also noted this unusual emission of staters (&quot;Croesus or Pseudo-Croesus?&quot; in Festschrift Mildenberg, p. 221, n. 
25), and, like Naster, placed them between the electrum and the gold of standard style.

Ex Nomos 3 (10 May 2011), lot 146. 

The lion on this piece has a style that is identical to that found on the ubiquitous Kroiseids struck under the Persians. Rather than being a novel 
fraction begun under the Persians, there may actually be a prototype that was struck under Kroisos. A small quantity of coins appeared on the 
market that are of the same type and weight as the present coin, but the style of the lion on these coins are identical to the lifetime issues of 
Kroisos: cf. CNG E-355, lot 125; CNG E-269, lot 136; and Hauck &amp; Aufhäuser 14, lot 80. Although those coins were not attributed to Kroisos 
in their sales, the appearance of this overtly Persian style piece makes it highly likely that these constitute a previously unknown forty-eighth 
stater denomination for each series of Kroiseids.

&quot;Bring me the head of the Baptist&quot; 
Aristobulus and Salome -Struck at the Beginning of the Jewish War 

347. 
KINGS of ARMENIA MINOR. Aristobulus, with Salome. AD 54-92. AE (20mm, 5.61 g, 12h). Dated RY 13 (AD 
66/7). ∫å45¬EW4 [år54to∫oU¬]o[U] Et 5˝, diademed and draped bust of Aristobulus left / ∫å45¬5[4-4˙4 4å]¬[o]Â˙4, 
diademed and draped bust of Salome left. Meshorer 365 var. or corr. (date); Hendin 1257a; RPC I 3840 var. or corr. (same). 
Fine, brown surfaces, even roughness. Extremely rare, possibly only the seventh known. Recent specimens at auction have 
hammered between $45,000 and $160,000. 
($5000) 

Aristobulus&apos; wife, Salome, was the widow of Philip the Tetrarch and the daughter of Herodias by her first husband, Herod II (known in the 
New Testament as either Philip or Herod). Although she is unnamed in the Gospels, it has been traditionally assumed that it was Salome -at 
the insistence of her mother, Herodias -who asked Herod Antipas (who was besotted with his young step-daughter) for the head of John the 
Baptist in return for her risqué dance for the king. As a result, Salome has become a symbol for dangerous female seductiveness. 

The regnal date on this issue has been variously read as 3 (Γ), 8 (H), or 13 (IΓ). As noted in Hendin, p. 275, Frank Kovacs observed that most 
of the extant examples of this dual-portrait issue are poorly preserved, and the dates are usually illegible or only partially visible; only the year 
13 is clearly visible on any of them. Kovacs asserts that the coins reported as years 3 and 8 are likely misreadings of year 13, and the present 
coin with the clear date 13 confirms that view. The only other issue of Aristobulus with a clear date is a year 17 bronze with the titles of Titus 
on the reverse. Issues in years 13 and 17 by a client king of Rome would have a pro-Roman propaganda and political value, as those years 
correspond, respectively, to the beginning of the Jewish War and the destruction of the Temple.

Ex Numismatica Ars Classica 64 (17 May 2012), lot 849. 

Seleukid oktadrachms were all ad-hoc issues, presumably produced for presentation purposes or as donatives. The present piece is no 
exception, as it was struck with an obverse die that was used to strike tetradrachms in an issue given to Uncertain Mint 68 in Mesopotamia 
in SC (cf. illustration of SC 1132.3b). The dating of the issue is based on the portrait style, which the authors of SC date circa 197-192/0 
BC. The appearance of this oktradrachm suggests that this mint may have been a place of some importance, but the historical circumstances 
are uncertain, as Antiochos was primarily involved in a conflict against the Ptolemies in Asia Minor. Perhaps this issue reflects some as yet 
unknown event to the east, as previously known issues of oktadrachms of Antiochos III have been linked to various military victories.

von Aulock 7636 (Sigeium). VF, rough brown surfaces. Very rare, Qedar notes eleven examples, only two in CoinArchives

($500) 

The identification of the portrait on this coinage as the satrap Tissaphernes is still debated. Some scholars note a similarity in style between the 
portrait here and that found on bronze coins of Astyra where the satrap&apos;s name appears below the bust. Others doubt this identification, most 
notably L. Mildenberg, in his article, &quot;The So-Called Satrapal Coinage&quot; in MIMAA. Nonetheless, the location of the mint is fairly secure, as 
six of the eleven known to Qedar were found in the Dora excavations. The prior attribution by von Aulock, followed by Meadows, to Sigeion 
was merely due to his acquisition of his coin there, and the fact that owls appear on issues of that city. Although these coins appear to have 
been from an issue of bronze, the last of the eleven coins that Qedar saw had silver plating, which appeared him to be original to the coin, 
leading him to conclude that all were originally fourrée drachms.

Ex Classical Numismatic Review 18.3 (3rd Quarter 1993), no. 507. 

As their name implies, Gallic War staters were issued to fund the fight against Julius Caesar in Gaul. Two explanations for the blank obverse 
have been suggested: firstly, to signify that the coins were minted by a coalition of tribes -&apos;headless&apos; in other words -and, secondly, to speed 
up the production process, because the coins were often made in a hurry. The latter rationale seems to be more plausible.

The object on the obverse was previously described as an &quot;uncertain object&quot;, but a comparison with Athenian coinages, which this series

Athens.

Ex Triton XII (6 January 2009), lot 425. 

Who the god Lrooaspo was is a matter of conjecture. One possibility is that he was an adaptation of Drvaspa, an Avestan deity, who was 
the guardian of the health of beasts. Another possibility is that he is a representation of the Mithraic deity Apam Napat, &quot;the grandson of the 
waters&quot;, and associated with Neptune. According to the Avesta, Apam Napat possesses the epithet Aurvat-aspa, or &quot;possessing swift horse&quot; 
(Yašt 19.51). Associated with both Mithra and Drvaspa, he is concerned with the preservation of Khavaeno, or legitimate princely authority, 
perhaps accounted for by the presentation of the diadem in his depiction on this coin.

Two Gandharan Rarities 

485. 
INDIA, Post-Kushan (Gandhara). Kidara Shahis. Sri Tujina. Circa 7th century AD. Base AV Dinar (22mm, 7.48 g, 
12h). Kushan style king standing left, sacrificing over [altar] and holding [filleted standard]; filleted trident to left, %Lân (śri 
tujina) in Brahmi in upper left, abtract monograms in inner and outer right fields / Goddess enthroned facing, holding [lotus 
or filleted investiture garland in left hand] and lotus in right; [Kidara monogram to left], ìY (jayo) in Brahmi to right. Cf. 
Cunningham, Coins of Medieval India 3-4 (there attributed to Toramana); otherwise unpublished in the standard references. Near 
EF. 
($5000) 

This and the following lot provide a rare opportunity to further numismatic knowledge regarding the post-Gupta issues of the region of 
Gandhara. Although these two coins have different obverses, they do share a similar reverse type, quite probably cut by the same hand, 
suggesting that they belong to the same source. Unlike the following lot, however, this coin&apos;s obverse with the highly stylized Brahmi 
monograms is of Kidarite origin and would continue to be used subsequently by their regional successors, the Kidara Shahis. Noting another 
example of this coin in the British Museum, Cunningham errroneously attributed the coin to Toramana. The obverse legend of this coin, 
however, clearly reads sri tujina in Brahmi, and to date this title has not been associated with that ruler. It is not impossible that such gold 
issues of a Toranama-type were adopted by local rulers, but, unlike the ubiquitous bronze drachms struck by the several successor kings, these 
gold coins have proven to be quite rare. 

486. 
INDIA, Post-Kushan (Gandhara). Kidara Shahis. Meghama[...]. Circa 7th century AD. Base AV Dinar (22mm, 
7.45 g, 12h). Siva Pashupati (Lord of the Beasts), nimbate and standing left, making mudra gesture with right hand and holding 
filleted trident in left; behind, lioness or tiger standing left with head right; trace of MGh, (meghama) in Brahmi in upper left 
/ Goddess seated facing on lotus, holding lotus in left and right hand; [Kidara monogram to left], ìY (jayo) in Brahmi to right. 
Cf. Cunningham, Coins of Medieval India 3-4 (for rev.); otherwise unpublished. Near EF. 
($7500) 

Prior to the discovery of a small group of similar examples in Kashmir, this coin type was completely unknown. Sharing a reverse type with 
the previous lot, this coin&apos;s obverse, with the figure of Siva Pashupati (Lord of the Beasts), appears quite stylistically similar to earlier Gupta 
dinars. To date, the obverse Brahmi legend has been visible, and can be read as meghama. This reading has led some scholars to associate this 
issue with Meghavana, a Gonaddha ruler of Kashmir, mentioned in the twelfth-century Kashmiri history, the Rajatarangini of Kalhana. The 
incompleteness of the legend, however, makes such a conclusion uncertain.

Because of the land&apos;s mountainous terrain and the need of the local populace for defensive sites, most early settlements in ancient Greece 
were established on high rock outcroppings. Known in Greek as an akropolis (pl. akropoleis), or citadel, these places were initially palace 
sites (megara) of the Bronze Age kings. During the Greek Dark Ages (circa 1100-800 BC), these akropoleis became refuges for the population 
of the towns which clustered around them. At the same time, they acted as each city&apos;s cultural center with numerous temples and shrines 
populating the site. 

The most famous Greek akropolis is that of Athens. Like other akropoleis, it has been occupied since the Bronze Age and figured prominently 
in Athens&apos; earliest mythology. Here, the contest between Poseidon and Athena for patronage of the city took place and her gift of an olive tree 
was located. Here too was the palace of Athens&apos; mythological first king, the chthonian Erectheus. Following the Greco-Persian Wars (490-
479 BC), the Athenians attempted to reconstruct the Acropolis, since its temples had been destroyed by the Persians. Under the leadership 
of Perikles (460-430 BC), during the so-called Golden Age of Athens, an ambitious building program was begun to make the Acropolis the 
center of the new Athenian hegemony. Financed in large part by the Delian League&apos;s treasury, which had been brought from Delos to Athens 
for safekeeping, most of the major buildings were constructed of Pentelic marble. In addition to a number of sacred precincts and smaller 
temples, several new constructions were included. The Erechtheum, a temple dedicated to Poseidon and Athena, contained the sacred olive 
tree and was located near the grave of Erechtheus. The Propylaea, or monumental gateway, sat at the summit of a long staircase which was the 
culmination of the Panathenaic Way and provided a grand entranceway to the Acropolis. The Temple of Athena Nike, built between 427 and 
424 BC, was the earliest temple constructed in the Ionic Order on the Acropolis. And among the sculpture which decorated the Acropolis was 
a colossal bronze statue of Athena Promachos, one of the earliest works of the sculptor Pheidias. 

The crowning achievement of the Acropolis was the Parthenon. Begun in 447 BC and dedicated to Athena, the Parthenon also acted as the 
state treasury, since it was here that the tribute of the Delian League was stored for safekeeping. A masterpiece of Greek engineering. it also 
was one of the most finely decorated of all the buildings of the Acropolis. Within the shrine was a large chryselephantine (gold and ivory) 
statue of Athena in full armor. Around the entablature of the naos was a frieze, which has been generally interpreted as the performance of the 
Panathenaea (although this interpretation has been challenged). And the sculpture groups in the Parthenon&apos;s pediments depicted the two events 
central to Athenian mythology: the eastern depicts the birth of Athena; the western, the contest between Athena and Poseidon. Considered the 
epitome not only of the Doric Order of architecture and the most important surviving building of the Classical period, the Parthenon (and with 
it the Acropolis) has become the visible symbol of all that was Classical Greece.

The &quot;Hand Puppet&quot; Glycon

right / The serpent Glycon coiled to left, with human head with long hair. RG 227; BMC 48 var. (Glycon coiled to right). Good 
VF, brown surfaces. Rare and exceptional reverse type. 
($500) 

This highly interesting coin depicts the deity Glycon, whose cult was the subject of Lucian of Samosata&apos;s scathing Alexander the False 
Prophet. Lucian (ca. AD 125-after 180) describes the cult as a fraud created by a medicine man named Alexander (ca. AD 105-170). According 
to the author, Alexander decided there was a fortune to be made divining the future, so he hatched a plan: the swindler planted a snake within 
the foundations of a new temple to Asclepius at Abonuteichus in Paphlagonia, and convinced the superstitious residents that its appearance 
fulfilled a prophecy that Asclepius would come to earth in the form of a serpent by the name of Glycon. Alexander is said to have outfitted 
the large serpent with a puppet head -the mouth of which he would move by pulling strings -that was topped with a long, blonde wig, a 
description that fits well with the tressed snake seen on our coin. We are told that worshippers of Glycon could visit the serpent and have their 
fortunes read…for a hefty sum paid to the puppet-master Alexander. 

Despite Lucian&apos;s scandalous accusations, the cult of Glycon spread dramatically during the 2nd century. By the time of Caracalla, we have 
evidence that Glycon was worshipped from the Danube to the eastern limits of the empire.

Continued Herodian support of the Romans allowed the dynasty to extend its influence beyond Jewish territories. Herod V, the grandson 
of Herod the Great, was granted the kingdom of Chalcis by Claudius in 41 upon the request of Agrippa I, and all of his rare coins name the 
emperor. His friendship with and loyalty to the emperor continued to benefit him; following the death of Agrippa in 44, Claudius extended to 
him authority over affairs at the Temple in Jerusalem, a right he retained until his death some four years later.

Scene Referred to by Josephus 

591. 
JUDAEA, Herodians. Agrippa I, with Claudius. 37-43 CE. AE (27mm, 14.46 g, 12h). Caesarea Maritima mint. Dated 
RY 7 of Agrippa I (42/3 CE). Laureate head of Claudius right; c/m: head left with oval incuse / Two figures (Claudius and 
Agrippa?) standing facing one another, each holding patera, within distyle temple; between, torso of figure holding uncertain

Agrippa I had a close relationship with both Gaius (Caligula) and Claudius, in part helping to secure the rule of the latter in the uncertain 
days following his unexpected rise to the purple by counseling the understandably shaken Claudius and entreating the Senate to support him. 
Indeed, his relationship with Claudius was sufficiently close that Josephus (Ant. xix. 5.1) records that among the new emperor&apos;s first acts was 
the publication of an edict guaranteeing Agrippa&apos;s kingdom (with the title &quot;great king&quot;) and granting the territory of Chalcis to Agrippa&apos;s elder 
brother Herod. 

Burnett believed the scene on the reverse represented the consecration of this treaty in Rome, a treaty which is specifically mentioned by 
Josephus (He also made a league with this Agrippa, confirmed by oaths, in the middle of the Forum in the city of Rome. [Jospehus, Ant. 
xix.5.1]). Although Suetonius (Suetonius, Claud. 25.5) also places the rites of the treaty (or fetial ceremony), which included the sacrifice of 
a pig, in the Roman Forum, Burnett argued that they instead took place at the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. Following Burnett&apos;s interesting 
argument, this rare Judaean bronze not only represents a religious ceremony before the holiest temple of Rome, but accurately depicts a 
victimarius (sacrificial assistant) about to kill a pig.

This remarkable and extremely rare issue not only explicitly refers to the alliance on the reverse, even using Agrippa&apos;s new title &quot;Great King&quot;, 
but depicts the oath taking ceremony that occurred in the Roman Forum and is discussed in historical sources: 

He also made a league with this Agrippa, confirmed by oaths, in the middle of the Forum in the city of Rome. (Josephus, Ant. xix.5.1) 

He struck his treaties with foreign princes in the Forum, sacrificing a pig and reciting the ancient formula of the fetial priests. (Suetonius, 
Claud. 25.5) 

This issue is typically found in poor condition with much of the legends illegible. The legends given here are taken from Burnett&apos;s study, 
reconstructed from the seven previously known specimens, although there are slight variants among them. For the extremely rare counterpart 
issue of Herod of Chalcis with a similar obverse, albeit with the position of the brothers switched, see Meshorer 361.

A highly unusual piece, probably part of the series of &quot;atypical coins&quot; (to use Prieur&apos;s term) with Mesopotamian mintmarks. The bust on the 
obverse certainly recalls portraits of Caracalla, but the beginning of the reverse legend clearly reads &quot;to the defied Severus, grandfather.&quot; Thus 
we might assume that this coin was struck under Elagabalus and can perhaps be associated with another unique dynastic issue linking the 
Syrian prince to his &quot;grandfather&quot; Septimius Severus (Prieur 1730). Furthermore, if this cataloger&apos;s reading of the reverse legend is correct, the 
final &quot;Π&quot; would seem to identify Caracalla as Elagabalus&apos; father, making the Caracallan-style portrait on the obverse particularly appropriate.

ROMAN REPUBLICAN COINAGE 

Oath-Taking

Oath-taking scene: youth kneeling left, head right, holding a pig between two warriors, one Roman and the other representing

This, the first gold coinage of the Roman Republic, was minted at a time of national crisis. In 218 BC, Hannibal, the Carthaginian leader in 
Spain, led his army across the Alps and invaded northern Italy, thus beginning the Second Punic War. The invader won a series of brilliant 
victories culminating in the battle of Cannae, in 216 BC, in which the Romans are said to have lost 70,000 men. Gold staters and half staters 
were struck at this time having as their obverse type a beardless janiform head perhaps representing the Dioscuri, the gods who gave special 
protection to the Romans on the field of battle. The attractive reverse type shows an oath-taking scene, the clear intention being to strengthen 
the resolve of Rome&apos;s allies in the face of Hannibal&apos;s intimidating presence.

From the Dr. Lawrence D. Sporty Collection. Ex C. W. Pearson Collection (Classical Numismatic Group Inventory 981554, April 2011). 

As consul for the year 88 BC, Sulla was awarded the coveted assignment of suppressing the revolt of Mithradates VI of Pontus, but political 
maneuvers resulted in this assignment being transferred to Marius. In response, Sulla turned his army on Rome, captured it, and reclaimed his 
command against Mithradates. His prosecution of the first Mithradatic War was successful, but he spared the Pontic king for personal gain. 
In 83 BC, Sulla returned to Italy as an outlaw, but he was able to win the support of many of the leading Romans. Within a year he fought his 
way to Rome, where he was elected dictator. It was during this campaign to Rome that this denarius was struck. The obverse type represents 
Sulla&apos;s claim to be acting in Rome&apos;s best interest. The reverse shows Sulla enjoying the highest honor to which a Roman could aspire, the 
celebration of a triumph at Rome.

From the RBW Collection. Ex Schweizerischer Kreditanstalt 5 (18 April 1986), lot 337. 

This moneyer is only known from his coins. The bust has traditionally been regarded as portraying Servius Sulpicius Rufus, who was 
responsible for raising the siege of Tusculum in 377 BC. But since the moneyer is a Servius, not a Sulpicius, this identification is probably 
inaccurate. The portrait does bear a remarkable resemblance to Brutus, and it possible that the coin was struck as an expression of political 
sympathy toward Brutus&apos; cause.

($7500) 

The production of dies by the mint in Rome was very carefully organized and controlled; this meant that many of the craftsmen employed 
there were highly specialized. There is good evidence that certain engravers did portraits and figures, while others just did legends. Even 
though the aurei signed by Aulus Hirtius were made very rapidly and in enormous numbers, it is clear that this specialization process was 
adhered to. On the reverse, the legend engraver suddenly found that he had misjudged the spacing and had almost ran out of room: he initially 
realized that he lacked enough room for the last three letters, S PR. So he drastically squeezed in the S!

Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus accompanied his father at Corfinium and Pharsalus on the side of Pompey. After his pardon by Julius Caesar, 
he retired to Rome in 46 BC. After Caesar&apos;s assassination, Ahenobarbus supported Brutus and Cassius, and in 43 BC was condemned 
under the terms of the Lex Pedia for complicity in the assassination. Ahenobarbus achieved considerable naval success against the Second 
Triumvirate in the Ionian theater, during which time this denarius was minted, but finally, through the mediation of Gaius Asinius Pollio, he 
reconciled with Mark Antony, who thereupon made him governor of Bithynia. He participated in Antony&apos;s campaign against the Parthians 
and was consul in 32 BC. When war broke out between Antony and Octavian, Ahenobarbus initially supported Antony but, disgusted by 
Antony&apos;s relationship with Cleopatra, sided with Octavian shortly before Actium. His only child, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, was married 
to Antonia Maior, the daughter of Mark Antony and Octavia. Their son, Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, married Agrippina Minor, the sister 
of the emperor Caligula, and was the father of the emperor Nero.

Restored Issue Under Trajan-Hadrian 

806. 
Augustus. 27 BC-AD 14. AR Denarius (19.5mm, 3.67 g, 12h). Restitution issue. Rome mint. Struck under Trajan-
Hadrian, circa 98-138 AD. Laureate head right / Caius and Lucius Caesars standing facing, two shields and two spears between 
them; above, on left, simpulum left, and on right, lituus right. RIC I -; RSC -; BMCRE 536, pl. 13, 18 corr. (misattributed to 
the reign of Augustus); CNG 102, lot 842. Good VF, toned, a few light scratches on obverse. Rare. 
($1000) 

The style and fabric of this coin suggest that it belongs to an anonymous restitution issue of either Trajan or Hadrian. The restitution issues of 
Trajan are well known since the coins are marked with Trajanic legends. The fact that this coin retains its original legend without any mention 
of the issuer suggests that it is not part of the great restitution series of Trajan, but part of an earlier or later anonymous issue. Apart from style, 
on all known specimens the lituus has a split base and is turned to the right, and the simpulum is large, rather bulbous, and turned to the left, 
features not seen on the issues of Augustus.

While a nominal ally of Rome, Odenathus, ruler of the wealthy eastern trade center of Palmyra and husband of Septimia Zenobia, took 
advantage of Rome&apos;s internal and external conflicts to expand his territories. The circumstances surrounding the assassination of Odenathus 
around 267 are uncertain, but we do know that Zenobia soon after took the title of Augusta and bestowed on her infant son Vaballathus the title 
of Augustus. Zenobia continued to expand the Palmyrene kingdom, seizing control of Egypt in 269 and, with it, the Roman grain supply. To 
further bolster her position, Zenobia claimed to be the descendent of such illustrious figures as Cleopatra VII of Egypt and legendary Queen 
Dido of Carthage. 

When Aurelian rose to the purple in 270, he pragmatically acquiesced to Zenobia and Vaballathus&apos; rule in the east while he concerned himself 
with stabilizing the situation in the west. By 272, he was prepared to campaign against the usurpers. Palmyra was sacked, and both Zenobia 
and Vabalathus were captured as they tried to make their way to Persia. Zenobia was brought to Rome and paraded in Aurelian&apos;s triumph in 
274. According to a later tradition, Aurelian, impressed by her beauty and dignity, later freed her and granted her a villa in Tibur, where she 
spent the rest of her life.

The higher-than-average weight for this coin, a weight that harkens back to the reign of Diocletian, suggests that this coin was part of a 
festaureus issue -coinage struck for a special celebration. Likewise, the reverse, showing Sol Invictus, is also unusual. While Sol Invictus was 
a particularly common type on Roman coinage, especially during the third quarter of the third century, his use as a type began to fall out of 
favor following Constantine&apos;s victory over Maxentius in AD 312 at the Milvian Bridge. Also, the depiction of Sol in Oriental attire is relatively 
rare in Roman coin iconography, and may be indicative of the purpose for this issue. Sol&apos;s appearance in form on a very rare issue of aurei of 
Galerius as Caesar from Alexandria certainly refers to that emperor&apos;s war against the Sasanians in AD 298, while later issues of Maximinus at 
Antioch and Alexandria have been associated with his persecution of the Christians. As there was peace between the Romans and Persians at 
the time of the present issue, its striking at Nicomedia, a mint held by Licinius, may allude to the resurgence of persecutions against Christians 
in his eastern territories in the years following his uneasy rapprochement with Constantine at Campus Ardiensis in AD 317.

This coin is almost an identical twin to the specimen we sold in Auction 102, lot 1099, but the mintmark is weakly struck on the present coin. 
The observations made for lot 1099 in 102, though, are still relevant: &quot;Although not listed for the Nicomedia mint by either RIC or RSC, 
the type is known for Heraclea with the mintmark SMH (RIC VIII 12, RSC 2B). One could argue that the very clear and delineated N in 
the mintmark of this coin is an H, but it is also possible that it is an unpublished type for the Nicomedia mint. On the other hand, the type is 
known for Constantius II at Nicomedia with the mintmark SMNA (RIC VIII 3, RSC 4b), which would seem to indicate that this coin is from 
Heraclea with a poorly engraved H in the mintmark. Also, the author of RIC VIII, J. P. C. Kent, noted that this listing was based on Cohen 
and that &apos;confirmation [is] required.&apos;&quot;

($750) 

During the later Roman Empire, coin weights began appearing with the legend exagium solidi, a phrase which has often been translated as 
&quot;the weight (or weighing) of a solidus&quot;, in order to deal with the practice of clipping. Exagium derives from the Latin exigere (lit. &quot;to drive 
out&quot;). However, extant examples of these weights vary and some weigh much less than the 4.5 g of a full-weight solidus. These lighter weights 
are thought to possibly represent the lowest acceptable weight for aurei, and were used to withdraw under-weight solidi from circulation and 
thereby maintain an acceptable weight standard minimum for solidi to circulate at full value.

Struck during the Sasanian siege of Jerusalem, which lasted from April-May of 614. Two follis variants were issued: one with a mint-mark in 
the exergue and one with XCNIKA. A developing flaw on an obverse die used for both variants indicates that the folles with ethnic were issued 
first, those with &quot;Christ conquers&quot; apparently struck as the situation became increasingly desperate (Bendall p. 313). Interestingly, although 
struck four years into Heraclius&apos; reign, these folles still copy the portrait of Phocas.

The portrait of Christ on Justinian&apos;s second-reign solidi differs significantly from that which appeared on those of his first reign. The depiction 
of Christ during Justinian&apos;s first reign followed an established iconographic tradition. The second portrait type, however, is more precise, and 
lacking the flowing hair and long beard of the earlier version. It is stylistically similar in appearance to then-current imperial portraits, and 
may represent a more novel interpretation of the association between the Church and the emperor.

Rare Early Trebizond Issue

toned, graffito (&quot;X&quot;) on reverse. Rare. 
($1000) 

This coin belongs to a rare issue that has been attributed to Nicaea in the past, but Simon Bendall&apos;s analyses of these coins reveal that they are 
more likely early issues of Trebizond under Andronicus Gidon. It could possibly be his second issue after a seemingly unique copper trachy 
with his name followed by &quot;Comnenus,&quot; a family from which he did not hail. The extreme rarity of that issue may indicate that his fallacious 
association with the Comneni was not well received. 

The icon of Christ Chalkites was kept in vestibule of the imperial palace at Constantinople and was closely associated with the emperor. Its 
appearance here may reflect hopes of a reunited Byzantine Empire.

Little is known for certain regarding the series of rare Lombardic municipal tremisses. Early scholarship suggests two differing chronologies: 
either the series was struck shortly before and shortly after the Lombardic conquest of the region, or by Charlemagne in the chaotic period 
following the capture of Desiderius. Bernareggi (Moneta Langobardorum, p. 85-91) evaluates these theories and suggests a third, more reasonable 
alternative, based on the progressive decline in weights. He suggests that the series of &quot;starred tremisses,&quot; bearing the names of cities but not of 
rulers, were issued circa 700-750, at a time when the Lombardic kings exercised only weak authority over the cities of the Po Valley. 

Neither can the legends be firmly interpreted. The obverse on these tremisses bears the name of a Tuscan city, along with the word FLAVIA. 
Various interpretations have been proposed: one that it is a traditional poetic civic honorific bearing some relation to the name of the ancient 
gens Flavia, that it indicates the cities followed the Jus Civile Flavianum, or that it indicates the right to issue these civic coins solely belongs 
to the king. Bernareggi (op cit., p. 102-4) notes that the title FLAVIA is also an epithet used by the Lombardic kings, and proposes that it 
represented a way for the Tuscan cities to maintain their strong traditions of autonomy while still acknowledging the Lombardic kings.

This very rare issue was struck at the behest of the recently elected President Cáo Kūn to commemorate the new constitution. Two types were 
struck in silver, of the same size weight as the dollar, and in gold, depicting the new president in both civilian and military dress. The gold 
examples were distributed to the senators. The dual typologyof this issue is indicative of Cáo&apos;s rise to power. A member of the Běiyáng Clique, 
a powerful warlord faction, Cáo only gained the vote by directly bribing the assembly members with 5000 silver dollars each.

This coin was part of an issue struck in 1939 to commemorate the re-establishment of the kingdom. The order for their production, placed 
through Spink, was delivered after the Second World War had started, and the coins were never delivered to the Greek authorities. Spink put 
the coins up for sale with a special concession from the Greek Government (see Spink Numismatic Circular, January 1941); the 100 drachmai 
were sold for £25. During the course of the war, Spink&apos;s offices were bombed and a number of these coins were lost. The original order placed 
by the Greek Government was for 140 pieces of the 100 Drachmai and 200 pieces of the 20 Drachmai.

GRATIUS SIBI ILLUM ESSE FACTURUM SI OBLIVISCI QUAM SI MEMINISSI DOCUISSET.&quot; Inside, eight numbered trays, 
lined in pale green velvet, with space for coins in seven and the final tray open. The bottom of the interior has a sticker reading: A 
LA BOULE • D&apos;OR/ Quai de l&apos;Horloge, No. 67/ fabrique de gaînerie./ LAGROUS,/ Succ r . de M. LÉVEILLÉ,/ à Paris. Lot also 
includes 14 monochrome prints of the life of Napoléon from an uncertain early 20th century Russian publication. ($30,000) 

A M. Legrous is known at 65 Quai de l&apos;Horloge from a report on an adding machine he invented (Bulletin de la Société d&apos;encouragement pour 
l&apos;industrie nationale. Vol. 27, no. 294, December 1828, p. 394-7). Later, in a report on the 1867 Exposition Universelle, the Gellée brothers, 
leather case makers, are noted as having taken over the business from M. Lagrous in 1832 (Exposition universelle de 1867: Rapports du jury 
international, Volume 3 -Groupe III, Classes 14 a 26, 1867, p. 452). Combined with the presence of a medal produced by the Englishman J. 
Mudie in 1820, the period this collection was completed can be narrowed to sometime between 1820 and 1832.

($500) 

The reverse imagery recalls Mendelssohn&apos;s impression of Kant&apos;s philosophy: a tower seemingly prepared to collapse, but set on strong 
foundations. A. Gulyga (Immanuel Kant: His Life and Thought [1984], p. 123-4) relates that an example of this medal was presented to Kant 
on the last day of the semester, 4 March 1784. The gift was not well received by the philosopher, no doubt a result of the poor likeness of the 
portrait, the misspelled name, and the incorrect birth year.

England Returns to the Catholic Church 

1137. 
ITALY, Papale (Stato pontificio). Julius III. 1550-1555. AR Medal (48mm, 46.54 g, 12h). Return of the Roman 
Catholic Church to England under Queen Mary. By Giovanni da Cavino. Dated RY 5 (AD 1554), though a contemporary cast. 
IVLIVS TERTIVS • PONT • MAX • A • V •, bust right, wearing zucchetto and mantum; IO • CΛVINO • F on truncation of bust 
/ ANGLIA RESVRGES, Pope Julius standing left, raising personification of England kneeling right, casting aside bow and

standing facing one another; in exergue, VT NVNC/ NOVISSIMO/ DIE. Cf. Johnson &amp; Martini 1172 (in bronze); Lawrence 
96; cf. Lincoln 553-5 (bronze); Mazio -; Eimer 31b (this medal illustrated); MI 70/15. Near EF, toned, lightly chased in 
obverse field. 
($10,000) 

This celebrated medal is most frequently encountered in French re-strikes made from the 18th Century onward (see Eimer 31c). Contemporary 
cast examples are extremely rare, especially so in silver. 

To complement his handsome portrait of Julius III on the obverse, Cavino took as his model for the reverse a very rare sestertius of Vespasian; 
&apos;Roma Resurges&apos; RIC ii, 2nd ed., 109. Cavino made struck copies (Paduans) of this sestertius, see Klawans 3-4. On the medal he added more 
participants to the scene. Pope Julius, who takes the place of Vespasian on the sestertius, raises England, who replaces Roma, to her feet. 
Cardinal Pole and the Emperor Charles V, substituted by Cavino for Minerva, accompany England. Behind the Pope stand Philip and Mary 
facing one another. Mary is clutching her stomach that appears swollen. This has been interpreted as alluding to the pregnancy that Mary 
announced in November of 1554. This was the same month Cardinal Pole came to London and the formalities of reconciliation with the Holy 
See were concluded in the English Parliament. Had a child been born and survived, English and European history would have taken a very 
different course, but tragically for Mary it was a phantom pregnancy.

1927-1; ABC 2810; SCBC 292. EF, toned. Possibly a contemporary imitation. 
($750) 

Certain stylistic elements of this coin are unusual for the series, such as the grains in the ear being composed of perfect dots and the crude 
engraving of the letters. While the weight and fabric are consistent with the official issues, these stylistic elements suggest that the coin is 
an imitation. That said, the style of the letter is reminiscent of the &apos;biga&apos; gold stater issue, so perhaps this may also be part of a heretofore 
unrecognized variety.

Philip de Jersey, in his study of Cunobelin&apos;s silver, noted the various Roman prototypes that the chieftain&apos;s coins appear to copy. Here, the 
obverse resembles the famous &apos;Vercingetorix&apos; portrait on denarii of L. Hostilius Saserna (cf. Crawford 448), while the reverse is adapted from 
that of the moneyer M. Cato (cf. Crawford 343 and 462).

Although Blunt placed all the coins of this moneyer under his North Eastern I mint, he noted that the style of the BMC 95 piece, struck from 
the same obverse die as the current specimen, was unusual. Perhaps equally important, he did not note that the reverse was actually a variety 
of the Horizontal-Trefoil/Two-line type, with a pellet in the bottom field, rather than a trefoil. The style here, in fact, is more refined than the 
large, bold lettering usually equated with the North Eastern I mint, and it also has the outer linear circle that is typically absent on issues from 
that mint. The authors of CTCE, however, did note the difference (CTCE, p. 112), and suggested that such issues may belong to the North 
Eastern II mint. Nonetheless, the style of the Two-line type coins from even that mint is still distinctly different from that on the present coin 
(cf. Blunt 421-4). As such it is likely that this coin was struck in a mint south of the former Danelaw.

Struck at York after Edmund&apos;s reconquest of Northumbria in 944. Ingalgar had an impressive stint at York, which traded hands between the 
kings of Wessex and the Vikings. After his appointment by Eadmund, he continued under Eadred (946-947), then under the Viking ruler Eric 
Bloodaxe (947-948), then under Eadred again (948-949), then under Anlaf Sithtricsson (Cuaran) (949-952), under Eric again (952-954), and 
finally under Eadgar, after he retook York in 954. His name is found on coins of all these rulers (see CTCE, chapters 6, 7, and 14).

As noted in CTCE, imitations from the reign of Eadmund are extremely rare. The authors note that almost immediately after the death of 
Aethelstan, Anlaf Guthfrithsson retook Northumbria and conducted raids into Mercia, and they suggest that any imitations of Edmund are 
possibly from areas controlled by the Danes until the recovery of the Five Boroughs in 942.

The War of the Spanish Succession, sparked by Louis XIV of France in his attempts to expand his hegemony, flared into a continent-wide 
conflict, with France, Spain, and Bavaria opposed by a coalition centered around England, Holland, and Austria. One aim of the Allies was to 
deprive Spain of the wealth derived from its American colonies. When Admiral Sir George Rooke, commander of the combined fleet, learned 
the 1702 treasure had arrived at Vigo Bay in Spain, he resolved to seize it. His force of fifty ships besieged the harbor, destroying the French 
fleet guarding the convoy, sinking most of the ships and capturing cargo worth some 2 million pounds at the time. A special issue of gold and 
silver coins was struck from the captured plate and a number of medals honored the great victory.

From the DNW sale: &quot;Very few coins seem to have been struck between the death of David I in 1153 and the introduction of the crescent 
and pellet coinage around 1180. It is possible that some posthumous coins in the name of David were struck at this time but named coins 
of Malcolm IV and William the Lion&apos;s first type are excessively rare. Burns records three specimens of William&apos;s first type in 1887 (B. fig 
25b-c-d) and by 1967 a fourth is mentioned by Stewart. From then until the present no further examples seem to have been published. It is 
interesting to note that R.C. Lockett had no specimen in his extensive collection although he owned no less than 23 sterlings of David I.&quot;

Named for the man who caused them to be struck, the various &apos;Fullerton&apos; denominations were the product of engraver John Milton. The 
Colonel was a fellow of the Royal Societies of London and Edinburgh and a Scots enthusiast whose idea was to create patterns, then coins for 
circulation in Scotland, bearing the likeness of the future George IV as Prince of Wales and High Steward of Scotland. Although the Prince 
of Wales granted permission for the production of these coins, their use of the English royal arms as well as the effigy of the Prince in place 
of that of George III, raised objections, and their production was halted. As a result, only some proofs in copper were struck. Later, Matthew 
Young obtained the dies and produced silver restrikes. After his attempt at this coinage, Fullerton went on to become Governor of the Island 
of Trinidad, and no more was heard from him numismatically. Curiously, Milton had earlier created the dies for the 1788 Barbados Penny, 
showing a large pineapple on its reverse, today a most popular piece. He became an assistant engraver at the Royal Mint, this post lasting 
from 1789 until 1798. He was also medallist to the Prince of Wales, which likely explains his interest in working with Col. Fullerton on these 
famous patterns.

Ex Sotheby&apos;s (9 March 1989), lot 94. 

This spectacular medal was awarded to those officers who had distinguished themselves in the Battle of Lowestoft, the first major naval 
engagement of the Second Anglo-Dutch War. War was declared in March 1665 after a period of mounting hostilities between colonial forces 
of the two countries including, most notably, the capture of New Amsterdam (later renamed New York) by the English in August 1664. On 
the 13th of June, a Dutch fleet, commanded by Lieutenant-Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam, engaged the English under the command of 
Charles II&apos;s brother, James, Duke of York, later James II. Despite having the weather gauge and out-gunning their opponents the Dutch failed 
to maintain the line of battle and were defeated with the loss of 17 ships and over 2000 men including van Obdam, killed when the magazine 
of his ship the Eendracht exploded. The victory was widely celebrated in England. A national holiday of thanks giving was declared for the 
20th of June. Sir Peter Lely was commissioned to paint the Flag officers who fought at the battle among whom was William Penn, Captain of 
the Fleet to the Duke of York, and father to the colonist of the same name. 

The medal continued to be awarded to men who distinguished themselves in naval actions later in the reign of Charles II. Surviving specimens 
in gold, stuck to the weight of 20 Guineas (without mount) and presented to officers of the rank of Captain and above are extremely rare: 
perhaps no more than five specimens being known.

Signed at the Dutch city of Breda on 31 July 1667, the Treaty of Breda brought the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667) to a hasty end due 
to the invasion of the Southern Netherlands by Louis XIV. Prompted by Michiel de Ruyter&apos;s successful &apos;Raid on the Medway&apos; a little more 
than a month earlier, which gave the Dutch control of the seas around the southern coast of England, the English quickly sued for peace. Under 
the terms of the treaty, the Dutch East India Company secured its control of the East Indies and the lucrative worldwide trade in nutmeg. They 
also gained concessions to the English Navigation Acts, which now allowed them to import German goods into England. In the long term, 
however, the treaty provided England with the opportunity to expand its overseas empire in North America. The unwillingness of the Dutch 
to recover Nieuw-Nederland, taken by the English in 1664 (its restoration had been an English concession to peace), now gave England full 
control of several new colonies (New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania), as well as the city of Nieuw-Amsterdam -now renamed 
New York City. The restoration of Acadia by the English to the French foreshadowed the series of wars that would be fought between the two 
powers for dominance in the North American theater, culminating in the French and Indian War (1754-1763).

The China trade was initially a remarkably one-sided affair, with a staggering demand for Chinese goods in the west, but scant need for 
western goods in China. But in the early 19th century, the British finally found a popular commodity and began to trade Indian opium to the 
Chinese in exchange for silver. This caused a reversal in flow of specie: where once New World and European silver flowed into China to pay 
for tea and porcelain, filling the Qing coffers, Chinese silver now flowed west to pay for addictive opium. With the drug not only weakening 
the minds of the populace, but also the treasury of the state, China banned the trade in opium in 1839, ordering all stocks seized. 

British merchants found the prohibition of such a popular trade good unacceptable and the situation soon escalated to war. Unfortunately for 
the Chinese, the Royal navy&apos;s steamships and modern rifles soundly defeated the antiquated Qing forces. The war ended in 1842, beginning 
what is known as the &quot;Century of Humiliation&quot; for the Chinese. The Treaty of Nanking forced them to cede to the British the city of Hong 
Kong, as well as pay an indemnity of 21 million dollars in silver. So much silver was paid to the British that, when it was melted down at the 
Royal mint, enough gold was extracted to permit the striking of a series of small medals.

THE PAMPHILL HOARD 

Vessel photo reduced 

1295. 

ROMAN IMPERIAL. temp. Valerian to Carus. AD 260-283. Lot of approximately five thousand four hundred-
fifty-three (5453) antoniniani of the mid to late 3rd century. All coins: Antoniniani from Valerian to Probus. Majority are of 
Gallienus and the Gallic emperors. Also included are issues mostly of Claudius II Gothicus (including some Divus issues), 
with issues also of Quintillius, Aurelian, Salonina, and Probus. Remainder consists of a number of illegible coins, fragments, 
and associated surface finds. R. Bland, &quot;Coin hoards and hoarding,&quot; BNJ 85 (2015), 445 and 514 = Coin Register 2013, 65 
and 66 = PAS DOR-148AF3 and DOR-148E55. Coins average Fine, all with patina. Coins are grouped in large brown paper 
envelopes, each envelope noted with general attribution. Lot includes the intact bottoms of two pottery vessels that contained 
the coins, as well as additional fragments of the vessels. 
($5000) 

In October 2011, the two separate pottery vessels, each containing antoniniani from the mid to late third century AD were found together 
near Pamphill in Dorset. The vessels themselves were broken, with only the bases intact. In addition to the deposited coins, approximately 
eight additional coins were found on the surface in the area of the pots and another six coins were discovered following the extraction of the 
vessels from the ground. 

The coins themselves were subsequently cleaned in the Department of Conservation and Scientific Research at the British Museum. The 
number of coins listed here is only an approximation based on the numbers in the original publication of the hoard. Purportedly since the 
discovery, a few coins have gone to the British Museum or elsewhere. 

Owing to the content of these vessels, with the latest recorded coin being an issue of Carus, a date of AD 282 or slightly later for their burial 
is plausible. It is uncertain whether they were buried concurrently or sequentially, with the the first vessel preceding the second. What is clear, 
however, is that both vessels, and the coins they contained, were related to one another. </unit>
