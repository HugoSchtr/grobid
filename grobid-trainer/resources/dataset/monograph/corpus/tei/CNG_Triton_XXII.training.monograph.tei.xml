AUCTION TERMS 

This is a public, mail bid, and internet auction conducted by Classical 
Numismatic Group, LLC (CNG). Bidding in the auction constitutes 
acceptance of the following terms: 

1. 
The property listed in this catalogue is offered for sale by 
CNG for itself and as agent for various owners and other consignors. 
We reserve the right to reject any bid, to determine the opening price, 
to set bidding increments, to vary the order of the auction, to reopen 
bidding in the case of a dispute, to withdraw any lot, to bid on behalf 
of CNG, to bid on behalf of the consignor, to permit the auctioneer to 
bid on his own behalf, and to permit the consignor to bid on his own 
lots. CNG may loan or advance money to consignors or prospective 
bidders, and may have an interest other than commission charges in 
any lot. CNG may bid on its own account as an &quot;insider&quot; with infor-
mation not available to the public. 

2. 
A buyer&apos;s fee will be charged to all successful bidders as fol-
lows on the hammer price: 
A. 22.5% for written, fax, email, telephone, and live internet bids. 
B. 20% for floor bids placed in person at the auction and electronic 
bids placed directly on www.cngcoins.com. 
All written bids, email bids, non-live telephone bids, live internet bid 
registrations, and live telephone bid registrations must be received 
before 5PM Eastern time on the day before the auction begins. CNG 
reserves the right to change the format of www.cngcoins.com at any 
time. 

3. 
All coins are guaranteed genuine. Attribution, date, condi-
tion, and other descriptions are the opinion of the cataloguer, and no 
warranty is expressed or implied. Please note that an auction sale 
is not an approval sale. Lots examined prior to the sale and lots 
purchased by floor bidders (including bidders executing commission 
bids on behalf of other parties) may not be returned for any reason 
except lack of authenticity. All claims of misdescription and all 
claims of return, except claims regarding authenticity, must be made 
within 5 days of receipt of material. Any claim of lack of authenticity 
must be made in writing by the original purchaser immediately after 
discovery that an item is not authentic, and upon making such a claim 
the original purchaser must immediately return the lot to CNG in the 
same condition as at the time of the auction. Coins that have been 
encapsulated (&quot;slabbed&quot;) by a grading and/or authentication service 
may not be returned for any reason, including authenticity, if they 
have been removed from the encapsulation (&quot;slab&quot;). If payment is 
made by credit card, rights of return are governed by these Auction 
Terms which supercede any rights of return promulgated by the card 
issuer. Estimates are intended as a guide only and not as a statement 
of opinion of value. 

4. 
Invoices are due and payable immediately upon receipt. 
Interest and late fees of 2.0% per month, or at the highest rate permit-
ted by law, whichever is less, from the date of the auction, shall be 
payable on invoices not settled within 30 days of the auction date. 
Payment may be made by check or bank wire. Credit cards (Visa 
or MasterCard) will be accepted; credit card payments will not be 
accepted more than 14 days after the sale date. Payment by credit 
card for printed sale auctions will be charged a 2.5% handling fee. 
Payment by check must be made in either US dollars ($) drawn on a 
US bank or British sterling (£) drawn on a British bank. All success-
ful bidders outside North America and the United Kingdom will be 
charged an additional $20 fee for bank charges that are the result of 
international wire transfer fees; this fee will be deducted for credit 
card or check payment as described above. CNG may reduce or com-
promise any charge or fee at its discretion. 

5. 
Bidders not known to us must provide us with satisfactory 
credit references or pay a deposit as determined at CNG&apos;s discretion 
before bidding. Minors are not permitted to bid without written con-
sent of a parent guaranteeing payment. CNG may require payment 
in full from any bidder prior to delivery of lots. Title does not pass 
until lots are paid in full. Upon receipt of lots, the buyer assumes full 
responsibility for loss or damage. Delivery to the buyer&apos;s address of 
record shall constitute receipt by the buyer regardless of the identity 
of the person accepting delivery. 

6. 
Estimates are in U.S. dollars ($US) and bids must be in 
even dollar ($) amounts. CNG will execute mail bids on behalf of 
mail bidders. Subject to reserves and opening prices, mail bids will be 
executed at one bidding increment (approximately 10%) over the next 
highest bid. In the case of identical bids, the earliest bid wins. A mail 
bid has priority over an identical floor bid. Bid by lot number. No lots 
will be broken. Bidders are responsible for errors in bidding. Check 
your bid sheet carefully. 

7. 
All lots are subject to reserve unless otherwise indicated. 
However, no reserve will be higher than the estimate, and ordinarily 
lots are reserved at 60% of estimate. 

8. 
Bidders personally guarantee payment for their successful 
bids, including bidders executing commission bids from other parties 
and bidders representing corporations or other entities. Buyers accept-
ing commission bids from other parties do so at their own risk and 
remain responsible for payment under these Auction Terms. 

9. 
At the conclusion of bidding for each lot, the sale contract is 
concluded and the successful bidder becomes liable for immediate 
payment under these Auction Terms. In the event a successful bidder 
fails to make full payment within 30 days of the auction date, CNG 
reserves the right either: (a) to require payment as provided under 
these Auction Terms; or (b) to deem the sale incomplete and to re-auc-
tion the material, in which case the successful bidder agrees to pay for 
the reasonable cost of such a sale and also to pay any shortfall between 
the re-auction price and the successful bidder&apos;s purchase price. CNG 
reserves all rights that it is entitled to under the Pennsylvania Uniform 
Commercial Code, including the right to offset any sums due from a 
successful bidder against any future consignment or purchase or mon-
ies or goods in possession of CNG. 

10. 
Sales tax, postage, handling and insurance are the responsibil-
ity of the buyer and are added to all invoices where appropriate. For 
buyers in the European Union, CNG may import lots into the United 
Kingdom prior to shipment and charge buyers the import Value Added 
Tax. On any tax not paid by the purchaser which should have been 
paid, even if not invoiced by CNG, the purchaser agrees to pay the 
same on demand together with any interest or penalty that may be 
assessed. It is the responsibility of the buyer to comply with foreign 
customs and other regulations. 

11. 
Prices realized are published after the sale and are mailed with 
CNG&apos;s next publication. Prices realized are also posted after the sale 
on CNG&apos;s web site: www.cngcoins.com 

12. 
Bidders hereby waive any claim for incidental, consequential 
or exemplary damages arising from this auction. The sole remedy that 
any participant in the auction shall have for any claim or controversy 
arising out of the auction shall be a refund, without interest, of all or 
part of the purchase price paid by the participant. 

13. 
All rights granted by CNG or otherwise available to bidders 
and purchasers, under these Auction Terms or otherwise, are personal 
and may not be assigned or transferred to any other person or entity, 
whether by operation of law or otherwise. No third party may rely on 
any benefit or right conferred by these Auction Terms. Bidders acting 
as agents must disclose the agency in writing to CNG prior to the auc-
tion; otherwise rights are limited to the agent and are not transferable 
to the undisclosed principal. 

14. 
Any dispute regarding this auction shall be governed by the 
laws of Pennsylvania and shall be adjudicated only by the Lancaster 
County Court of Common Pleas or the U.S. District Court for the 
Eastern District of Pennsylvania; all bidders submit themselves to 
the personal jurisdiction of these courts for this purpose, consent 
to service of process by registered or certified mail, and waive any 
contrary provisions of Articles 14 or 15 of the French Civil Code and 
any similar provisions in any jurisdiction. All bidders consent to the 
confidentiality of consignors&apos; identities and waive any right to require 
disclosure of the name of the consignor or owner of any auction lot, 
whether such right is based on New York GOL  §5-701(a) or any other 
provision in any jurisdiction. In any dispute regarding this auction, the 
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and 
attorney fees.

The Mike Gasvoda Collection of Greek Coinage 

The Gasvoda Collection has come to auction over the past four years 
with Mike&apos;s Twelve Caesar Collection being dispersed in 2015 and 2016. 
The remainder of his ancient coins are being sold through several sales at 
CNG, with the highlight coins all appearing here in Triton XXII. This sale 
includes Mike&apos;s coinage of Magna Graecia, Sicily, and the remainder of 
the Greek world. His focus was primarily on the incuse coinage produc-
ing cities of Kroton, Sybaris, Metapontum, Kaulonia, and Poseidonia. 
The depth of the incuse specimens from each of these locations is out-
standing, both from a quality and an academic standpoint. The coins from 
Sicily span the entire island, but focus mostly on the signed die engravers 
of Syracuse, with several truly outstanding examples from this city. 

Mike also had a keen interest in facing head coinage and numerous ex-
amples are to be found from his collection in this sale. The facing head 
tetradrachms of Katana and Syracuse are both wonderful coins of not 
only great artistic merit, but also of significant rarity. Couple these with 
the range of facing head coinage of Metapontum, Kaulonia, Ainos, Lar-
issa, Rhodes, and Asia Minor, and the breadth of artistry found in this sale 
is simply amazing. 

The partially facing heads of the incredible drachm of Naxos (see back cover) and the similarly beautiful Mende 
tetradrachm complete the collection of master engravers works for this style. 

There are coins in extremely high state of preservation throughout this collection. The Katana tetradrachm with 
the man-headed bull obverse is exceptional for the issue. The Siculo-Punic issues are wonderful, as is the Ka-
marina and the incredible coin of Aspendos, which has full head detail of each of the three athletes. Finally, the 
selection of stephanophoric tetradrachms is fairly complete and absolutely beautiful. 

Other than some fractional issues of Magna Graecia, which will appear in a future CNG sale, this offering con-
cludes the sale of the Gasvoda ancient coin collection. 

The MNL Collection of Seleukid Coinage 

CNG is proud to present the third and final installment of the MNL Collection, perhaps the finest collection of 
coins of the Seleukid kings to be offered since the dispersal of the Arthur Houghton Collection in the late 1980s 
and early 1990s. The MNL Collection includes coins from many important collections, most notably Houghton, 
but also Abramowitz, Bement, Charrin, Niggeler, Petrowicz, Pozzi, Seyrig, and Weber, among others. In addition 
to containing many pedigreed examples, this collection is also notable for the quantity of published examples it 
contains, as well as the many rarities and unpublished varieties that will inevitably be included in future additions 
to the Seleucid Coins catalog. 

MNL, an accomplished collector and connoisseur of Seleukid coinage -indeed mentored by Arthur Houghton 
himself -is also an avid wine enthusiast as well as a gourmet cook. The words of MNL convey this dedicated 
collector&apos;s approach to the numismatic avocation best: 

More than a decade has passed since the inception of the MNL collection, and as coins are meant to circulate, 
this collector is passing them on to the next generation of Seleukid enthusiasts. After the death of Alexander the 
Great in Babylon, his successors -including Seleukos I -spent the next 40 years fighting among themselves for 
their piece of what was once one of the world&apos;s largest kingdoms, stretching 2 millions square miles. Every an-
cient saga has winners and losers, heroes and villains, the ambitious and the indolent, times of peace and -more 
often -times of war. These coins have paid soldiers and merchants, taxes and tribute. Their study will reward the 
patient far beyond their value in the past. I hope you enjoy their history as much as I have. [MNL]

The Michel Prieur Collection 

Michel Prieur (1955-2014) was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a suburb of 
Paris, and spent much of his childhood in Africa and the Middle East. 
In 1988, he founded Compagnie Générale de Bourse (cgb.fr), the largest 
numismatic firm in France. Michel combined a scholarly approach to 
numismatics with a passion for promoting the hobby. He was a pioneer 
in ushering numismatics into the digital age, and was extremely proud of 
his website, which is available in a staggering seven languages and offers 
a wealth of information for collectors through their archives, blog, and 
monthly online newsletter Le Bulletin Numismatique. Michel authored 
numerous articles on French coins and banknotes, and was co-author of 
the Le Franc, a popular reference modeled on Whitman&apos;s &quot;Red Book.&quot; 

To collectors of ancient coins, Michel is best known for his publication 
of A type corpus of the Syro-Phoenician tetradrachms and their fractions 
from 57 BC to AD 253 (Lancaster, PA, 2000), which he co-authored with 
Karin Prieur. This corpus built on decades of active research and careful 
recording of the series, and will long remain the standard reference on this 
often-complicated series. Michel was always extraordinarily generous 
with his time and knowledge of this series, and personally assisted this 
cataloger on a number of occasions. 

Readers will take notice that many of the following lots from the collection have been cited and/or illustrated 
in publications, not only in Prieur&apos;s own book but in Roman Provincial Coinage Vol. III and Richard McAlee&apos;s 
Coinage of Roman Antioch, among others. Bidders are also encouraged to view lots 278, 281, 344, 345, 365, 373, 
374, and 376 in the Greek section of this sale for additional coins from the Prieur Collection. 

Additional coins from the collection will be made available in Triton Session 5 (Electronic Auction 436) and 
throughout 2019. 

The Alan J. Harlan Collection of Roman Republican Coinage 

Alan J. Harlan was born in Ravenna, Ohio in 1951. He holds B.A and J.D. degrees from The Ohio State Univer-
sity, and currently resides in Dallas, Texas, where he has been practicing law for the past thirty-seven years. Mr. 
Harlan has two grown daughters and two grandchildren. 

Like most budding numismatists of his generation, Alan began collecting 
United States small cents and nickels in blue cardboard Whitman fold-
ers, armed with only a copy of the Red Book, at the age of thirteen. Over 
the years, his numismatic interests broadened to include, at one time or 
another, U.S. patterns, Colonial issues, Canadian silver dollars, and med-
als of the United States Assay Commission. His advanced collection of 
20th century United States Assay Commission medals was auctioned by 
Bowers and Merena Galleries, in a sale bearing his name, in December 
of 2003. 

While Alan&apos;s general interest in ancient Greek and Roman coins goes 
back to the late 1970s, he didn&apos;t begin studying them in earnest until near 
the end of the 20th century. Having inexplicably retained, for a number 
of years, a dog-eared copy of the NFA 27 auction catalog, which fea-
tured many choice and rare Republican and Imperatorial denarii from the 
collection of Roberto Russo, he not surprisingly gravitated to the silver 
coinage of the Roman Republic. And while he has since expanded his 
interests to include Imperial denarii and the coinage of Magna Graecia, 
the focus of his collection has remained, up to now, Republican and Im-
peratorial denarii, many of which are featured here in Triton XXII.

From the consignor: The city of Tarentum was founded in the late 8th century BC by Spartan colonists on the north coast of the gulf of the 
same name, on a rocky islet at the entrance to the only secure harbor. It was Sparta&apos;s only colony and maintained close relations with the 
mother city. It was not until late in the 6th century that Tarentum felt the need to produce local coinage. It did so by copying the broad, thin 
fabric with incuse reverse type already in use by Metapontum, Sybaris, Poseidonia, Kaulonia, and Kroton. Tarentum quickly grew in power 
and wealth. Blessed with fertile land, it became famous for olives and sheep. It possessed a fine harbor, great fisheries and profitable exports 
of wool, purple, and pottery. The official founder of the city was believed to be the Spartan leader Phalanthos. Ancient tradition, however, tells 
how Taras, the son of Poseidon, was miraculously saved from a shipwreck by his father, who sent a dolphin on whose back he was carried to 
shore, at which spot he founded a city. At some point history and mythology merged.

From the consignor: The most interesting type of the incuse coinage of Metapontum certainly must be the issues which include the locust (or 
grasshopper) design detail, as here. There are a number of variations. Here it is paired with a dolphin in outline. The locust would have been 
a serious threat to the agricultural community and likely the dolphin relates to Apollo who would have been seen as the God who eliminated 
a plague of these insects in the year this coin was struck.

The dolphin was not visible on any of the examples seen by Noe, and thus is not noted in his study. Nearly all of the published examples are 
poorly struck, and thus the appearance of the dolphin was apparently not discovered until this piece and another (CNG E-140, lot 7) were 
offered in 2006. The dolphin does not appear among the various symbols employed on the dies of this issue; however, it is employed, in an 
incuse or outline form, on the reverse of a few archaic issues, circa 540-510 BC (cf. HN Italy 1742).

From the consignor: This Sybaris specimen boasts an extremely high relief strike for this series. Note the doubling visible on the reverse, 
particularly on the forepart of the bull. This multiple strike format is typical for this issue but it usually results in a shift on the obverse die, 
resulting in normal relief. Here the reverse die shift is significant, while the obverse die remains close to perfectly aligned. The end result is 
a coin of very high relief.

($5000) 

From the Gasvoda Collection. Ex David Freedman Collection (Roma VIII, 28 September 2014), lot 14 (further pedigree to CNG is erroneous). 

From the consignor: Thourioi arose out of the ashes of Sybaris, which had been first besieged and destroyed by neighboring Kroton in 510/9 
BC. Attempts to refound the city were foiled by Kroton over the next decades, until the refugees from Sybaris appealed to Sparta and Athens 
for help in gaining back their homeland. Athens sent ships, soldiers and colonists that were able to repel the Krotoniates, allowing the city to 
be refounded, now as Thourioi, circa 446/5 BC. However, the unhappy Sybarites were again driven out of the new city only a few years later. 
The new coinage of Thourioi would relate to both the support of Athens and to the foundation history of the original city. The helmeted head of 
Athena is the obverse type while the butting bull, recalling Sybaris, adorns the reverse. This specimen, perfectly centered and in a wonderful 
state of preservation, represents one of the earlier coins from the repopulated city.

(Gemini VII, 9 January 2011), lot 61; J. Pierpont Morgan Collection (not in H. Schulman or Stack&apos;s sales; further pedigree listed for Morgan 
91 is erroneous). 

From the consignor: The incuse coinage of Kaulonia is fascinating to study as it offers a unique perspective into how this form of coinage 
was actually struck. Of the five cities in Magna Graecia that produced incuse coinage, each has features unique to its location. The coinage 
of Kaulonia is known for the die bounce that appears in the upper reverse left quadrant of the coins with great regularity. This is seen by 
the border impressions that appear in the reverse field. This and the following lot are two nearly perfect examples of early nomoi, each 
exhibiting similar die indentations. This is clearly the result of the method with which the two dies were held in place when the coin was struck. 
Recreating this consistent die bounce is most easily done by the use of slotted dies. Further study of this fascinating coinage will likely focus 
on the coins of Kaulonia as they offer the best understanding of the minting process employed in Magna Graecia.

From the consignor: Temesa was located on the western side of the Italian peninsula and was known to have producing copper mines. The 
city had historically been affiliated with, and likely protected by, Sybaris. When Kroton defeated Sybaris in 510 BC, the alliance with Temesa 
was transferred to Kroton. As was the case with many affiliated cities, Kroton issued coins identifying the relationship. These coins likely were 
issued by Temesa as well. The city was lost to the Locri around 480 BC, and joint coinage ceases after this date, but resumes sometime after 
475 BC (see lot 106, below). This is an extremely rare example of the incuse type for this alliance and probably the finest in private hands.

From the consignor: Overall, I think this example is superior to either the ANS or Gorini pieces. The ANS example is sharp, but badly doubled 
on the obverse, and the Gorini one is very weak on the octopus. A very rare type that is missing from most major collections.

From the consignor: As Kroton closed out the final phase of incuse coinage, the city began a new &quot;raised detail&quot; design with a series of 
silver nomoi that showed an eagle in varying poses. Several of these depictions are represented on this and the following three lots. All are 
extremely artistic, with the eagle portrayed in often dramatic positions. With this transition the tripod, for the first time, is engraved in a three-
dimensional view. This early full-relief coinage can be viewed as the peak period of artistry for Kroton.

From the consignor: The reverse type, the infant Herakles strangling two serpents, is highly artistic and was struck during a time of superbly 
talented engravers working at the main coin-producing cities of Magna Graecia. This is a rare type and certainly among the best survivors 
of those coins. The father of Herakles was Zeus, who had impregnated Herakles&apos; mortal mother, Alkmene. Hera was naturally unhappy with 
the impending birth and had two serpents placed in the crib of the infant Herakles. Being the son of Zeus, the babe easily strangled them.

From the consignor: The type of Herakles Epitrapezios (&quot;Herakles at the table&quot;) shows the hero reclining in the midst of his labors, enjoying 
a relaxing cup of wine. Phyllis Lehmann, in Statues on Coins of Southern Italy and Sicily in the Classical Period (New York: H. Bittner &amp; Co., 
1946), makes a connection between this coin type and a series of later statues in the manner of Lysippos, linking both to a common source, 
probably an earlier statue at the temple of Hera Lakinia at Kroton, one of the most prominent sanctuaries in Italy.

From the consignor: A second example of this famous alliance between Kroton and Temesa, but this time after the brief loss of control to the 
Lokroi. The raised relief example is nearly as rare as the incuse variety, but here it includes the ethnic below the helmet &quot;TEM.&quot; 

As recently as the publication of Historia Nummorum Italy (2001), many scholars had dismissed this issue as the product of modern forgers 
(cf. HN p. 193). This conclusion was primarily founded on the forgery of this type created by Becker in 1828 (Hill 14), combined with the 
extreme rarity of the extant examples. Nonetheless, a few examples are known that are clearly not pieces from Becker&apos;s dies (e.g. Basel 234). 
Perhaps most significantly, these scholars overlooked the existence of an example in F. Carelli&apos;s manuscript catalogue of 1812 (C. Cavedoni, 
Francisci Carellii Numorum Italiae Veteris Tabulas CCII [Leipzig, 1950], pp. iii and 97), which clearly existed at least 15 years prior to 
Becker&apos;s forgeries. 

Very little is known today about the history of Temesa (also known as Tempsa) other than that the city was either of Aitolian or Phocaian 
origin, and is thought to have been linked to the city of Sybaris. Following Kroton&apos;s destruction of Sybaris, Temesa was apparently dominated 
by Kroton, as evidenced by this coin type. These nomoi feature the tripod, the civic badge of Kroton, and were paralleled by a similar issue 
at Kroton (see lot 84, above, for information on these issues). From the later fifth century BC, Temesa was conquered by a number of other 
cities until finally falling under Roman domination. With the chaos of its later history, it is not surprising that this is its sole known coinage.

Colonists from Gela founded Akragas circa 580 BC on a plateau overlooking the sea. Under the tyrants Phaleris and Theron, it quickly 
grew into one of the most prosperous and populous Greco-Sicilian cities. In 473 BC, the people overthrew Theron&apos;s son and established 
a democracy. From its earliest coinage circa 510 BC, Akragas featured an eagle, sacred to Zeus, backed with an overhead view of a crab, 
harvested as a delicacy in the region. After the coming of democracy, the crab design was augmented with a number of other attributes, here 
a delicate vine scroll with each end terminating in a flower bud.

Situated on the southern coast of Sicily, Gela was founded in 688 BC by Cretans and Rhodians. By the turn of the 5th century BC, it rose to 
become the most influential state on the island. In 485 BC its ruler, Gelon, seized Syracuse and transferred his capital there, taking with him 
many of the leading citizens of the city. His brother Hieron, later tyrant Hieron I of Syracuse, was left in charge of Gela. Tetradrachms were 
first struck at Gela circa 480/75 BC, shortly thereafter becoming the principal denomination of the Geloan coinage, and remaining so down 
to the time of the destruction of the city by Carthaginian invaders in 405 BC. The ultimate design of the tetradrachms was a racing chariot, 
borrowed from the Syracusan coinage, and the forepart of a man-headed bull. The rather brutal half-length figure of the man-headed bull is 
based on the &apos;father of all rivers&apos;, Acheloös, and is clearly identified by the ethnic Gelas as the personification of the river Gelas rushing to its 
mouth, where the city of Gela stood. It was mentioned by Virgil (Aen. 3, 702) as &apos;immanisque Gela fluvii cognomine dicta&apos; (and Gela named 
after its impetuous river).

Originally founded by settlers from Syracuse in 598 BC, Kamarina was dependent upon its relations with its mother-city for much of its 
history. A revolt in 553 BC left the city devastated and partly abandoned, until 492 BC, when the expansionist tyrant Hippokrates of Gela was 
granted the site in return for a peace treaty with Syracuse. Hippokrates re-founded the city a second time with groups of mercenaries from his 
many wars across Sicily, and Kamarina became a source for new recruits. It is believed that this is the time of the first coinage of Kamarina, 
with its martial design of a panoply of arms. The first period of coinage ended in 484 BC, when Hippokrates&apos; successor Gelon forcibly 
relocated its residents to Syracuse. Kamarina was re-founded a third time in 461 BC, by settlers from Gela and, at least until the 420s BC, the 
city remained attached to its parent-city. During this period, Kamarina rebuilt its akropolis defenses, public buildings, and road system. At 
least one athlete from the city, Psaumis, was victorious at the Olympics, a feat celebrated in Pindar&apos;s fourth and fifth Olympian odes. At the 
outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, Kamarina did side with Athens, although a strong pro-Spartan faction remained in the city. In 427 BC, 
Laches, who had been sent from Athens with a fleet for the purpose of bringing Sicily into the war, tried to elicit the support of Kamarina 
with a naval treaty, but the stipulation that allowed for only one Athenian ship at a time shows that Kamarina was less than enthusiastic about 
supporting Athens. During this period, Kamarina had taken Morgantina and in 424 BC received legal right to it as part of a peace treaty with 
Gela. Two years later, along with Akragas, Kamarina gave Athens a favorable anti-Spartan response when Athens again tried to elicit support 
in Sicily. Between 422 BC and 415 BC, both Athens and Syracuse pressured Kamarina, which remained neutral, for support. As Syracuse was 
becoming the leading power on the island, when troops from Sparta arrived there in 413 BC, Kamarina offered 500 hoplites and 300 javelin 
throwers as support. Soon, however, the Athenian threat was replaced by one from Carthage which, between 409 BC and 405 BC, conquered 
or destroyed the cities of Selinos, Himera, Akragas, and Gela. While preparing for a defense of Gela and a potential attack on Kamarina, the 
Syracusans compelled the citizens of Kamarina to evacuate to Syracuse. The city virtually ceased to exist until Timoleon re-founded it a fourth 
time in 399 BC.

Founded about 730/29 BC by the colonists from the neighboring Chalkidian colony of Naxos, the city of Katane was located on the eastern 
coast of Sicily on the fertile Katanian plain near the southern limits of the lava flows from Mt. Aitna. Like its neighbor to the north, Leontini, 
the city prospered from its exploitation of the fertile plain for the production of barley. When it began striking coinage in the mid-fifth century 
BC, Katane included on its issues the local river, Amenanos, which was responsible for the fertility of the soil. Like other contemporary Greek 
riverine depictions, the river-god is portrayed as a human-headed bull (see lot 117 above). Later issues, however, perhaps influenced by other 
regional coinages, give the river-god a more youthful and androgynous appearance. 

Katane&apos;s prosperity attracted the attention of its immediate and more-powerful neighbor Syracuse. In 476 BC, Hieron I expelled the population 
from Katane, driving them north to Leontini. In turn, Katane was &quot;refounded&quot; with a new body of colonists consisting of Syracusan citizens 
and Dorian mercenaries. Renamed Aitna, it issued a short-lived and very rare coinage, featuring the head of Silenos on the obverse and either 
Zeus or his thunderbolt on the reverse. This Syracusan overlordship was short-lived, and in 461 BC the original inhabitants of Katane were 
restored to the city, while the inhabitants of Aitna were withdrawn to the fortress of Inessa, which they renamed Aitna. To commemorate the 
reinstatement of its original inhabitants, Katane struck a remarkable series of tetradrachms featuring the river-god Amenanos on the obverse 
and Nike holding a wreath, diadem, or fillet on the reverse. Several different adjuncts, such as a Silenos or a ketos are included on the obverse 
as well. Such additions may be evidence of regional influences resulting from Katane&apos;s recent history. Such is the case after about 460 BC 
when this issue was replaced by one featuring a quadriga similar to that of Syracuse, but without the additional Nike, on the obverse and the 
laureate head of Apollo, similar to that of Leontini, on the reverse (see lot 118 above). 

Katane continued to prosper until the late 5th century BC, when the city entered a period when it became continually embroiled in conflicts 
between other states. In 415 BC, Katane was attacked and captured by Athens, which used the city as the base of operations for the first 
year of the famous Sicilian Expedition. Later, in 403 BC, Katane fell to Dionysios I of Syracuse, who, like Hieron I before him, re-founded 
the city, this time with Campanian mercenaries. In the period leading up to this conflict with Syracuse, the coinage of Katane underwent 
another transformation. By the late 5th century BC, the numismatic art of Sicily had achieved an unparalleled degree of quality in the Greek 
world. This was due in large part to the great masters whose signatures are boldly displayed on their minute canvasses: Choirion, Euainetos, 
Eumenos, Exakestidas, Kimon, and others. Most of these artists are known from their work in the Syracusan series, but a few also created 
masterful works of art at other cities as well. One of these, Herakleidas, created a magnificent facing head type that is a standout among the 
famed Katanean issues. Certainly influenced by the Kimonean facing-head portraits of Arethusa on tetradrachms at Syracuse, the subject here 
was the god Apollo, whose profile portrait was featured on the reverse of earlier issues of Katane. 

Here, the god&apos;s portrait has become the prominent feature of the coin, moving to the obverse and appearing in a nearly frontal aspect. One 
may sense Herakleidas&apos; attempt to portray Apollo in a naturalistic form, retaining through his countenance an attitude of an other-worldly 
god, while introducing a delicacy that conveys the thought of a living being. The hair falls in individual locks reminiscent of Arethusa of 
Syracuse, but rather than radiating outward, as if in an aquatic environment, they are depicted in a downward splayed fashion, evoking the 
picture of a woodland entity whose natural appearance would retain a hint of the wild. His laurel wreath is likewise splayed, as though placed 
upon his head directly from the laurel bush, without any thought of molding or preparation. In contrast, his wide eyes gaze outward with an 
obvious power that belies his heavenly nature. The viewer has the impression that he is looking into the face of a living god. Herakleidas&apos; work 
represented the high point of numismatic artistry at Katane, a period that was cut short by the conquest of the city by Dionysios I. 

In the early 4th century, Katane&apos;s close relationship with Syracuse made the city a target for the Carthaginians. In 396 BC, they captured 
Katane, and held it for about 50 years, until it was finally liberated by Timoleon in the 340s BC. When Pyrrhos landed in Sicily in 278 BC, 
Katane was the first Sicilian city to welcome him, opening its gates and receiving him with great pomp (Diod. 19. 110; 22. 8). By the time 
of the First Punic War, however, Katane submitted itself to Rome, a friendly arrangement that allowed the city to regain much of its former 
prosperity. Katane was ravaged a final time, by Sextus Pompey, during the Roman Civil War, but its refoundation as a colony under Augustus 
resulted in a renewed prosperity as a provincial town.

In the Hirsch sale of the Berlin duplicates, this coin received a rare lengthy note: 

Euböische Drachme von wundervollem Uebergangsstil. Cabinettstück ersten Ranges. Avers und Revers einzigartig im Raume stehend. 
Pracht-exemplar, wohl das schönste der bekannten Exemplare und deshalb von grösster Seltenheit. [Euboean drachm of wonderful transitional 
style. Choice example of the first order. Obverse and reverse superbly well centered and struck. Magnificent example, probably the finest of 
the known specimens and therefore of the utmost rarity.] 

On the day of the sale, the coin hammered at 2225 DM, an exceptional amount for a drachm, and the same price that the Berlin Museum&apos;s 
Naxos tetradrachm of Cahn 54 type realized in the same sale. 

Located on the eastern shore of Sicily in the shadow of Mt. Aitna, Naxos was the oldest of the Greek colonies on the island, founded in 735 
BC by colonists from Chalkis in Euboia and Ionia. According to Thucydides (1.100), Naxos established its own colony by founding Leontini 
in 730 BC, which was soon followed by the foundation of a second colony, Aitne, later known as Katane. Taking advantage of the fertility 
of the surrounding volcanic soil of Mt. Aitna, Naxos developed an economy of viticulture, and along with Leontini and Katane became very 
prosperous. This wealth attracted the attention of Syracuse, which subjugated Naxos in 476 BC, removing its citizens along with those of 
Katane to Leontini. Upon the death of Hieron in 461 BC, the Naxians were reinstated to their original city, and formed a close alliance with 
Leontini and Katane. During the first Athenian Expedition in 427 BC, Naxos actively provided support to the Athenians, who had sent a large 
fleet to support the allies against Syracuse. In 409 BC, Naxos sided with Syracuse against the Carthaginian threat to Sicily, but in 403 BC, the 
tyrant Dionysios of Syracuse turned against the Naxians, destroying the city and selling the women and children into slavery. 

The present issue is composed of multiple denominations in silver, and is dated by Cahn to the first few decades after the refoundation of 
the city in 461 BC. Some theorize that it was struck upon the refoundation as a celebratory issue, but one wonders whether the city had the 
resources for such a coinage so soon. It could also have been struck somewhat later, after the city had prospered from its trade ties to Kamarina 
and Leontini, and could afford the requisite silver for such a large output. The types found on the drachms are the same as that on the famed 
tetradrachms (Cahn 54), and the styles of both are so close that it is likely they were engraved by the same hand. The obverse features 
Dionysos, the god of the vine. The reverse is also an allusion to wine and the Dionysiac cult, featuring the satyr Silenos. Half-man, half-goat 
followers of Dionysos, these satyrs were often depicted in an ithyphallic state as they pursued the god&apos;s female attendants, the mainads. 
Silenos was the oldest, wisest, and most drunken of the satyrs. According to Euripides&apos; only surviving satyr-play, the Cyclops, Silenos had 
been forced to attend to Polyphemos, who dwelled in the region of Mt. Aitna, hence providing another reason for Silenos&apos; appearance on this 
coin of Naxos.

With the exception of a small group of imitative tetradrachms, which he places at Panormos, Boehringer suggests (pp. 68-72) that the 
&quot;barbarous imitations&quot; in his corpus were struck at the various cities of the Sikels, such as Henna or Herbessos. However, his assignment 
of issues to this category appears to have been based strictly on style, and while some issues clearly are foreign in style, others are only 
marginally different, such that they may, in fact, be official issues of Syracuse. This is particularly evident among the various litrai that 
Boehringer considered imitations, and, in this cataloger&apos;s opinion, the present piece is likely not imitative.

The Signing Artists at Syracuse 

The magnificent artistic flowering in Sicily in the 5th century BC has its origins in times of great strife. When the first colonists from Greece 
arrived on the fertile island in the 8th century BC, they found competitors in both the aboriginal inhabitants (the Sicels, Sicani, and Elymi) 
and the Punic colonists who established Carthage at about the same time. The social stresses set up by these conflicts prepared the way for 
the establishment of tyrannies. Hippokrates of Gela was the first of the well-known tyrants, and his son Gelon founded the greatest of the 
Sicilian courts at Syracuse in 485 BC. By the middle of the century, the situation began to resemble that of Renaissance Italy, where local 
princes engaged in continual warfare among themselves while engaging the services of the finest artists and craftsmen of their time in order 
to promote their standing. Such fighting required significant amounts of money, and the increasing cultural sophistication of the courts 
encouraged experimentation in all of the arts, including coinage. The result was the patronizing of some of the most talented coin engravers 
in history. In Syracuse and surrounding cities, the anonymous &quot;Demareteion Master&quot; and the &quot;Maestro della foglia&quot; were followed by their 
students and successors who proudly signed their work; such artists as Choirion, Euainetos, Eumenos, Exakestidas, Herakleidas, Eukleidas, 
among others. These masters developed new ways of viewing the world through art, abandoning static representations in favor of new and 
dramatic methods of portraying motion and life in miniature. Although we find masters working on even the smallest of denominations, the 
creation of dies for silver tetradrachms preoccupied engravers, as this denomination was struck in large quantities to finance the operations of 
the Greek hegemons. Most remarkable of all were the large silver dekadrachms of Syracuse, which have become universal symbols of Greek 
numismatic art.

This masterful facing head tetradrachm sets Kimon apart from all of his &quot;signing master&quot; contemporaries in Sicily. His rendition of the nymph 
Arethousa displays a degree of delicacy and control that set a new precedent in die engraving. The composition&apos;s beautiful three dimensional 
perspective is augmented by a fluid style that effectively conveys the natural motion of the nymph&apos;s hair in her liquid environment. The 
nymph&apos;s underwater environment is further emphasized by the placement of the dolphins, who weave themselves within her hair in a playful 
manner. The serenity of Arethousa&apos;s countenance, with her full, pouting lips and other-worldly gaze from her almond-shaped eyes, conveys 
a sense of her place aloof from the realm of man, while the entire scene firmly secures her within our natural world. One may sense the pride 
Kimon took in the completion of his masterpiece, as his name is prominently engraved upon Arethousa&apos;s ampyx. 

We know that Kimon&apos;s tetradrachm was as revered for its beauty in the ancient world as much as it is today, as it became a model for facing-
head issues of other cities, both local, such as Segesta, and around the Mediterranean, such as Larissa in Thessaly and Tarsos in Cilicia.

The reverse of Kimon&apos;s dekadrachm design features a highly individualized head of Arethousa, clearly modeled on a contemporary Greco-
Sicilian woman, possibly the same model employed for his remarkable facing-head tetradrachm (see previous lot). The head displays little of 
the idealization typical of his contemporary master engraver, Euainetos, and the details vary considerably from die to die. Her hair is bound in 
an elaborate jeweled net and a wide hairband, or ampyx, on which is placed the engraver&apos;s initial K; a full signature is located on the dolphin 
below her neck. Kimon produced only six signed Arethousa dies for the dekadrachm series; another seven dies are in his distinct style, but 
without signature.

The engraver Euainetos seems to have begun his series of signed dekadrachm dies a few years after Kimon; perhaps he began as an apprentice 
and &quot;graduated&quot; to master status. His dekadrachm design superseded that of Kimon and became a paradigm for coinage throughout the 
classical world. His Arethousa is less human and more divine than his predecessor&apos;s vision. The wreath of grain ears woven into her hair 
symbolizes the agricultural bounty of Sicily. His racing chariot is the essence of action, almost photographically frozen in time, with the 
charging, rearing horses appearing to levitate above the ground line. The design was widely copied on later coinage of Syracuse, as well as 
by the Carthaginian forces in Sicily.

This spectacular tetradrachm was struck during the first phase of the rule of Agathokles, a military strongman who seized control of Syracuse 
in 317 BC. His early coinage as &quot;Tyrant&quot; closely follows the decadrachm design of Euainetos struck nearly a century before, with the head of 
Arethousa now moved to the obverse. A triskeles, a symbol closely associated with Sicily, now appears on the reverse above the racing chariot. 
Although closely following the Euainetos paradigm, the skill of engraving and production standards for this type can vary considerably. This 
specimen is certainly among the finest surviving examples in terms of style, strike, metal quality and eye-appeal.

The Kore tetradrachms of Agathokles were struck following a major victory over Carthaginian forces outside the gates of Syracuse in 310 
BC, which prompted him to name himself King of Sicily and adopt the style and trappings of a Hellenistic ruler. The reverse, depicting Nike 
erecting a trophy, proved highly influential and was widely copied by Greek kingdoms and Romans centuries hence; a near-contemporary 
issue of Seleukos I Nikator has a similar reverse design, though Nike is more demurely clothed. The Kore tetradrachms are found in two 
main varieties based on the engraving style, termed &quot;Sicilian&quot; and &quot;African,&quot; although both were probably struck in Syracuse. This piece 
exemplifies the finest Sicilian style and is clearly the work of a master engraver.

Although since the late 6th century BC relations between Rome and Carthage had always been maintained on a friendly basis, Rome&apos;s 
growing influence in Magna Graecia in the early decades of the third century BC led inevitably to an increasing rivalry between the two 
powers. The Italian state was being drawn inexorably into the bitter politics of the centuries-old dispute between Greeks and Carthaginians 
in Sicily. This magnificent medallic piece was issued at about the time of the outbreak of the First Punic War which, after almost a quarter of 
a century of fighting, was to bring about the end of the Carthaginian presence on the island. Find spots for these coins have been exclusively 
Sicilian, and they were presumably struck for military purposes. Although horses had always been popular on Carthaginian and Siculo-
Punic issues, the depiction of the winged Pegasos represented a departure from tradition. The influence of the Corinthian coinage and that of 
her colony Syracuse seems obvious. The typically enigmatic Punic inscription translates &quot;in the land,&quot; and the Carthaginian stronghold of 
Panormos on the north coast of western Sicily has been suggested as the mint for this impressive series.

Although there are no control marks on this issue, the distinct and unusual portrait style here--with the long downswept hair on the forehead, 
and mostly bare neck--is identical to that found on many tetradrachms of Thompson 166-7 (cf. Bement 897) and their associated drachms 
(Thompson -, but cf. Triton XVIII, lots 3 and 423). It is likely that the staters of Thompson 165, which also belongs to the same issue as the 
aforementioned silver, will have a similar obverse style, and possibly a die match, but no examples can be located of that issue (which may 
be an erroneous entry in Thompson&apos;s listings).

Based on the style of the coins, Raymond argues that this dynast was not of the Bisaltai (Raymond p. 115, n. 4), but rather an independent 
tribal chieftain who retained a semblance of autonomy while paying tribute to Alexander I of Macedon. Most references retain the Bisaltai 
attribution, though, and placement among the Paeonian kings (ANS) is even more conjectural.

The satyr and nymph type is one of the more widely occurring designs in early Thraco-Macedonian region. Variations of this type were used at 
mints from Siris in the northwest to Thasos in the southeast. Similarly, tribes in this region -the Dionysioi, Laiai, Letai, Orreskii, Pernaioi, and 
Zaielioi -also used this type. They often included their respective ethnic, although some of these tribes replace the satyr with a centaur. Based 
on the positioning of the figures, there are two major divisions of the satyr-nymph type. The first group, struck primarily at Thasos, shows the 
nymph held in the arms of the satyr, who carries her off to the right. The other group, struck primarily at Siris, shows the nymph confronted 
by the satyr. In both cases the appearance of the figures is largely the same: the satyr is presented nude and ithyphallic, while the nymph is 
dressed in a long chiton with the skirt divided into many long strands. The only stylistic difference between the groups is the appearance of 
the lower body of the satyr. On the first group, the satyr has the normal legs and feet of a man, while on the second group, in addition to a tail, 
the satyr has the legs and hooves of a goat. Overall, the artistic style of the scene is wonderfully archaic, and evident not only in the posture 
of the figures, but also in its minute details. While most of the mints ceased production after about 480/470 BC, Thasos continued to use the 
type for some time, allowing the scene to transition through an &quot;archaized&quot; phase, and finally taking on a lovely early Classical style by the 
time production of the type ended there circa 404 BC. 

Kraay&apos;s view (ACGC pp. 148-9) was that the coins where the satyr and nymph are both standing show the nymph seducing the satyr, while 
the coins where the nymph is in the satyr&apos;s arms show the nymph protesting her abduction. However, this view is contradicted by a close 
inspection of the coins themselves. In similar scenes of this event depicted elsewhere, the satyr clearly manhandles the nymph, forcibly 
grasping one of her arms, while the nymph appears in a posture of apparent flight (see, e.g., HPM pl. VII-VIII). Clearly, in both scenes the 
nymph is protesting the actions of the satyr or centaur, who, in the role of the wild, libidinous creature that he is, is seizing the nymph for his 
own purposes, driven by his sexual arousal.

MACEDON, Akanthos. Circa 525-470 BC. AR Tetradrachm (27.5mm, 17.28 g). Attic standard. Lioness right, 
attacking bull crouching left, biting into its hindquarter; above, head of roaring lion right; floral ornament in exergue / 
Quadripartite incuse square. Desneux Type G.1, 82 var. (unlisted dies); AMNG III/2, 4 var. (control mark); HGC 3, 383; de 
Luynes 1536 = Traité I 1678. EF, attractively toned. Well centered and struck. Rare issue with lioness. 
($5000) 

From the sixth to the early fourth century BC, the lion and bull design was common to the tetradrachms of Akanthos, though a few rare issues 
depict a lioness rather than a lion. The earliest Akanthos tetradrachms are characterized by thick, dumpy flans, a variable style of incuse, and the 
head of the lion in three-quarter perspective. Subsequent issues have a flan that is relatively thinner and broader, an incuse of a more regularly 
quadripartite style, and the head of the lion in profile. The floral symbol in the exergue, which first appeared in some of the earliest tetradrachms, 
became more stylized in these later issues. Subsequently, a pellet-in-annulet appeared above the lion in the upper field of the obverse, followed 
by the addition of a subsidiary letter, and, finally, letter combinations and symbols to distinguish later issues in this large series. 

Most of these tetradrachms show a stylistically archetypal lion attacking the bull, evidenced by its thick mane and bold joints and lines. 
However, two groups of tetradrachms (Desneux Types C and G) have felines that are represented with much finer lines, smooth joints, and a 
subdued, evenly constructed mane that Desneux identified as depictions of lionesses. Some dies show the lioness decorated with spots, leading 
some to suggest that it may be a panther, but in any case the design is certainly based on the archetypal lion and bull motif that was imported 
to Macedon from the east (Persia), and is found on many coinages of the period. 

The motif appears frequently in art of the ancient Near East and Greece. See Willy Hartner, &quot;The Earliest History of the Constellations 
in the Near East and the Motif of the Lion-Bull Combat,&quot; Journal of Near Eastern Studies 24 [1965], pp. 1-16, who identified its earliest 
representation on a prehistoric Elamite seal of the fourth millennium BC. For its appearance in Greek art, see the KY Painter in the National 
Archaeological Museum in Athens [Accession Number 12688] and Desneux, p. 55. Reliefs from the Persian capital at Persepolis depict this 
type and the Lydian coins of this same period, though they do not show this type specifically, are surely a conscious echoing of this theme. 

Why then the use of a lioness, rather than a lion on this particular type? Herodotos may provide a possible clue. According to him (7.125-126), 
the Persian army was attacked by lions (οἱ λέοντες) while bivouacking on the eastern fringes of Greece and Macedonia. Accordingly, although 
lions were rare or nonexistent in most of Greece by the classical period, we know that they still roamed areas near Akanthos. Artists (including 
die cutters) knew the characteristics of both male and female from direct observation, which has apparently been reflected on the coin designs.

The city of Mende, located on the Pallene Peninsula on the eastern shore of the Thermaic Gulf, was, according to Thucydides (4.123.1), 
founded by Eretria in the 8th century. It later founded colonies of its own: Neapolis on the eastern coast of Pallene, and Eion at the mouth of 
the river Strymon near Amphipols. Mende&apos;s wealth is indicated by the high amounts of tribute paid to the Delian Confederacy: eight talents 
until 451-450 BC, and then amounts ranging form five to nine talents after 438-437 BC. During the Peloponnesian War (431-404 BC) Mende 
originally sided with Athens, but then, on the urging of the oligarchs, went over to the Spartan general Brasidas. It eventually returned to the 
Athenian side, but is not mentioned in connection with the Peace of Nicias. From 415-414 BC, Mende again appears in the Athenian Tribute 
Lists, but by the fourth century the city was only minting copper coins.The Dionysiac types of Mende proclaim it as a famous wine producing 
city, as attested by its amphoras that have been found throughout the Mediterranean. On this delightful coin, Dionysos, who rules wine and 
winemaking, is shown being carried home drunken from a symposium, a type of careless joy that links the world of men with the Olympians 
-at least until the morning.

This coin type had long been ascribed to the Bisaltai, one of the powerful Thraco-Macedonian tribes that struck coinage in the late 6th and 
early 5th centuries. The weight of the evidence now points to it being the earliest issue of Alexander I, when he was allied with the tribes 
against the Persians; he presumably struck coins with types that were acceptable to his allies and would, in fact, symbolize their alliance.

The reverse die link of this and the CNG 60 coins to the Goldberg 53 piece necessitates a correction to Troxell&apos;s die study. In her study, she 
thought that the break between Groups II and III occurred between obverse dies 15 and 16. However, this coin is struck from obverse die 15, 
while the Goldberg coin is from obverse die 16. Thus, the coins struck from obverse die 16 are in Group II, and Group III begins with obverse

The staters of Lokris stand among the finest artistic creations of Classical Greek coinage. The head of Persephone on the obverse is directly 
influenced by the famous depiction of the same deity by the artist Euainetos on the dekadrachms and tetradrachms of Syracuse. It has been 
suggested that Lokrian mercenaries served in the wars in Sicily undertaken by Dionysios I of Syracuse, and these warriors returned home with 
a quantity of Syracusan coins that served as the model. The reverse displays the famous warrior Ajax, who was the leader of the Lokrians in 
the Trojan War. The refined nature of this coinage seems out of place at such a relatively insubstantial city as Lokris. It has been suggested 
that these staters began as a monetary contribution, in lieu of soldiers, to Sparta during the latter&apos;s military exploits following the Corinthian 
War, while Kraay argued that the coinage was produced for military needs during the Sacred War. Regardless of the purpose, this coinage was 
produced from dies executed by exceptionally skilled engravers, and exemplifies the high art of Classical Greece.

Chester Starr arranged Athens&apos; coinage from ca. 480 until the mid 5th century into five groups, and his chronology is still widely accepted 
today (although the dating of his Group V coins is now considered too late). By the time of Starr&apos;s Group IV, production of tetradrachms 
had steadily increased and the uptick in the number of required dies (and engravers) necessitated a greater standardization of style. On the 
obverse, the head of Athena changes little from Starr&apos;s Group III -the goddess has a bold profile and retains her &quot;archaic smile&quot;; the hair on 
her forehead is arranged in two waves, with somewhat greater uniformity than previous periods; and on her helmet, her leaves float above the 
visor (sometimes referred to as a &quot;laurel wreath,&quot; these leaves were first introduced after the victory over the Persians in 480/79 BC). On the 
reverse, the owl&apos;s rear leg is often stretched back, and her tail is split into three flared feathers. Owls of this period are generally smaller than 
those depicted on later issues, as is the size of the letters comprising the ethnic.

The present coin represents a splendid example of this magnificent ancient work of art, with a surface quality far exceeding that of the 
specimens offered over the past several years. It exhibits clear flow lines, very sharp detail junctures, and a crispness often lacking in such 
large module ancient coins. Additionally, the aesthetic quality of the reverse is exceptional, an extremely powerful design with a well defined 
and expressive owl in full glory. 

The historical context of the Athenian dekadrachms, as well as concomitant tetradrachms and didrachms of the same class, has been the 
matter of extended debate. Much of the early confusion stems from a passage in Herodotos, who said that Athens paid ten drachms to each 
of its citizens for surpluses from the Laurion mines (7.144.1). Although this passage appeared to provide easy historical evidence for the 
dekadrachm issue, not every scholar was convinced. It was Ernest Beulé who first raised the chronological question of the issue, and from 
whom all subsequent research stemmed. Taken in context, the passage in Herodotos would place such an issue shortly after the victory at 
Marathon in 490 BC, a date that was accepted for the dekadrachm issue by prominent early numismatists, Babelon (Traité II, col. 769-770) 
and Head (HN, pp. 370-371), but which subsequent scholarship has shown to be far too early. Although Gardner retained the 490 BC date 
of issue in keeping with Babelon (A History of Ancient Coinage, 700-300 BC, p. 162), he added to the discussion by recognizing that the 
Athenian dekadrachms were contemporary with those of Syracuse, which he identified with the Demareteia mentioned in the ancient sources 
and dated to the immediate period following the battle of Himera in 480 BC. Seltman, in his major work on the pre-Persian coinage of Athens, 
rejected Babelon&apos;s conclusions. Yet, he also failed to put credence in the views of Gardner and subsequently placed the issue far too early, in 
the later 480s BC. Almost immediately, this view came under fire. Robinson saw Salamis as the occasion for issue (NC [1924], pp. 338-340), 
and Regling, in his revised edition of Sallet&apos;s Die antiken Münzen, viewed the combined victories of Salamis and Plataiai as the occasion. It 
was Kraay (NC [1956], p. 55; ACGC, pp. 66-68) who, paying attention to the evidence of the hoards, noted that Seltman&apos;s chronology was 
far too early; yet, he failed to convince his critics. Starr, whose own study of Athenian coinage also relied on the evidence of the hoards, 
confirmed some of what Kraay had argued, and suggested that the occasion for the issue of the dekadrachms was the battle near the river 
Eurymedon (circa 469/5 BC). The subsequent discovery of the Asyut Hoard (IGCH 1644) in 1968/9 and the Elmalı Hoard (CH VIII, 48) in 
1984, confirmed a mid-460s BC date. 

Various interpretations of the dekadrachms&apos; purpose have also been proposed. Although Fischer-Bossert suggests that the size of the issue 
indicates an economic, rather that ceremonial purpose, Head, much of whose work had formed the basis of dekadrachm scholarship, thought 
they were special, ceremonial issues struck at various times for &quot;the personal gratification of Tyrants or Kings&quot;, and were not part of the actual 
currency. As seen above, Starr&apos;s survey of the Athenian coinage, and his confirmation of Kraay&apos;s earlier conclusions, rejected this earlier 
conception. It seems clear that such an exceptional and compact issue must have served some special function. Recent scholars have focused 
on two key historical events during this period that could have produced sizable quantities of silver for this series: the battle of the Eurymedon 
River in 467 BC, where the resulting captured Persian booty was enormous and was attested to have been distributed (Plutarch, Vit. Cim. 
13.6-8), and the capture of Thasos and its mines in 463/2 BC, where the plunder is assumed to have been substantial (Plutarch, op. cit. 14.2). 

The dekadrachms stand apart from the typical Athenian coinage not only by their massive size, but the transformation of the reverse type 
from an owl in profile to one facing the viewer. One cannot fail to notice the power in such a portrayal, which clearly is a representation of 
the growing Athenian military might that produced the victory over the Persians at the Eurymedon River and the later capture of the bountiful 
Thasian mines.

On Starr&apos;s Group V tetradrachms, Athena&apos;s helmet decoration remains similar in form to his Group IV, but the arrangement of the hair is 
notably different. The wave has been abandoned, with the hair now falling over the forehead in one long swoop. On the reverse, the lettering 
is still quite small (although we begin to see a gradual enlargement on some dies). The owl&apos;s tail remains flared, but the treatment of the legs 
has become more standardized. While earlier groups often rendered the owl with one leg drawn back, the legs on Group V tetradrachms are 
consistently parallel and a bit more rigid in their execution.

The head of the land tortoise on this massive coinage is typically engraved shown from above, with the tortoise looking forward. Very rarely 
are they encountered with the head shown in profile. The profile head was canonical on the earlier, sea turtle coinage, thus the land tortoise 
coins of this variety may represent a short transitional issue at the beginning of this period.

Mysterious Mythological Creature 

233. 
MYSIA, Kyzikos. Circa 550-500 BC. EL Stater (21mm, 16.01 g). Winged male mythological creature running-
kneeling left, head right, holding tunny by its tail in left hand / Quadripartite incuse square. Von Fritze I 123; Greenwell 57; 
SNG BN 271; Boston MFA 1457 = Warren 1471; SNG von Aulock 1198 = Kraay &amp; Hirmer 704 = L. Mildenberg, &quot;Über das

($10,000) 

While the identification of this creature, certainly of local significance, is unknown today, it has traditionally been referred to as &quot;Phobos&quot; 
or &quot;Daimon.&quot; In his catalog of the Gulbenkian collection, Jenkins sees an Egyptian or near-Eastern influence, while Bivar, in his article on 
Mithra (&quot;Mithra and Mesopotamia,&quot; Mithraic Studies [Manchester, 1975], pp. 275-89), suggests that the creature corresponds to the Mithraic 
Areimanios (Ahriman). One also may see an assimilation of the ubiquitous Persian lion-headed griffin, adapting the head, wings, and tail to a 
human body. Although some references note the head as being that of a wolf, other examples clearly show a mane that is directly influenced 
by the lion heads on the common early Lydian electrum, supporting Bivar&apos;s (and others&apos;) contention that it is a lion head. At the same time, the 
ear is not fully visible on most examples, but on some, such as the present piece, it clearly is that of a griffin (compare to its depiction on the 
coins of Teos and Abdera). The wings and posture of the creature are mythological archetypes, commonly found on displays of various deities 
and creatures on pottery and coins. An excellent example of an archaic representation of a local deity of Asia Minor.

This issue had long been attributed to the island of Syros based on the reverse legend. Recent scholarship, however, has convincingly shown 
that this attribution is erroneous, as the reverse legend does not contain an ethnic, but names the type: the Divine Syrian Kaberioi. As the issue 
has long been linked to a rare portrait emission of Eumenes I with the same reverse type, it is clear that it must belong to a mint in the sphere of 
the kings of Pergamon. Although it is tempting to attribute it to the royal mint at Pergamon, this Attic-standard issue could have been struck at 
one of several mints under Attalid control. See A. Meadows, &quot;The Closed Currency System of the Attalid Kingdom&quot; in P. Thonemann, Attalid 
Asia Minor (Oxford, 2013), pp. 184-91 for the most current analysis of this intriguing coinage.

From the consignor: This type is rather common but becomes significantly rarer when the body of the bee is full or nearly so, as here. The 
relief is so high that coins were either not fully struck up, or wore so fast during use that the bee suffers. Although slightly off center, this is a 
nice example for the issue.

Rare KUKALIṂ Hekte 

258. 
KINGS of LYDIA. temp. Ardys -Alyattes. Circa 630s-564/53 BC. EL Hekte -Sixth Stater (10mm, 2.34 g). Sardes

30141 (same die and punches). VF. Very rare. 
($2000) 

This rare issue, with the nearly full legend KUKALIṂ, has been the object of much scholarly debate. At the time of Weidauer&apos;s study, 
she argued that the names WALWET and […]KALIL[…] (the full legend was then unknown), are not the names of kings but more likely 
the names of magistrates. Since Weidauer&apos;s publication, other examples have come to light, allowing the full legend to be discerned as 
KUKALIṂ, which translates to &quot;I [belong] to Kukaś&quot; (for a detailed linguistic explanation of how this conclusion was reached, see Wallace, 
KUKALIṂ, p. 38). The Lydian name Kukaś could be transliterated into Greek as Gyges (Γύγης), just as the WALWET could be transliterated 
into Greek as Alyattes (Ἀλυάττης). Although G.M. Browne (&quot;A new Lydian text,&quot; Kadmos 39 [2000], pp. 178-9) found it attractive to assign 
those coins with the KUKALIṂ legend to the early Lydian king Gyges (circa 680-644 BC), Wallace has shown on numismatic grounds 
that this cannot be correct. Observing punch links between hektai with the KUKALIṂ legend (Weidauer Group XVIII) and those with the 
WALWET legend (Weidauer Group XVII), as well as visible signs of wear and damage on these same punches between the two series, 
Wallace argues that the WALWET and KUKALIṂ issues were roughly contemporary. Thus, the Kukaś of the KUKALIṂ coinage was a 
close contemporary of Alyattes named Gyges, rather than the earlier Lydian king of the same name. Most likely this Kukaś was a member of 
the Lydian royal family, since the design for the anvil die may have derived from a royal seal showing opposing lion heads. Wallace further 
argues that there are two distinct groupings within the larger Lydian series, which can be attributed to separate mints, with the KUKALIṂ 
coins belonging to the group he assigns to a subsidiary, or &quot;branch&quot;, mint. If these coins were struck by a subsidiary Lydian mint in one of 
the territories it controlled (cf. Herodotos 1.6.1), then Kukaś may have been its governor, just as Kroisos had been in Adramytion before he 
became king of Lydia (Nic. Dam. FGrH. 90, fr. 65). 

While Wallace&apos;s evidence for the contemporaneity of the WALWET and KUKALIṂ coinage is firmly based, his evidence for the two 
groupings is speculative, and not convincing. First, he argues that there are two forms of obverse dies, one with two opposing lion heads 
separated by the signature, and another form that shows only one lion head before which is the signature. An inspection of the published 
examples, however, shows this is probably incorrect. Whenever there is sufficient space on the dies to show whether there is an opposing head 
on the die, an opposing head is always present (cf. Weidauer 91-94, 97-98, and 100-102). All other examples do only show a single lion head, 
but all of these have flans that are too small to see whether another head is opposite the one that is visible (cf. Weidauer 95-96 and 99). It is 
therefore most likely that all of the trite and hekte dies feature two opposing heads separated by the signature. Wallace also argues that there is 
a distinct stylistic difference between the two groupings, with the &quot;branch&quot; mint group having a more &quot;primitive and rustic&quot; style. Again, an 
inspection of the published examples renders this subjective observation moot, as there is a wide variation of style across all of the dies, from 
which one may discern multiple groupings. What is more likely is that the dies were created by a variety of engravers, whose styles varied 
somewhat from one another. In sum, the WALWET and KUKALIṂ coinage were all likely struck contemporaneously during the reigns of 
Ardys or Allyates, at a single mint in the captial Sardes. The translation of the names, WALWET to Allyates and KUKALIṂ to Gyges, is 
certain, but the identification of these individuals and the reason for their use on this series are as yet unknown.

The Carian city of Antioch, located near the eastern end of the Maeander valley, was founded on the south bank of the river Maeander, where 
the river is joined by a major tributary, the Morsynos River, flowing north from Aphrodisias. It was a Hellenistic settlement that was founded 
by Antiochos I Soter (though some argument has been advanced in favor of Antiochos III), and likely through a synoecism of two villages, 
Symmaithos and Kranaos (Pliny, NH 5.108). The location was a significant crossing point of the Common Road over the Maeander, between 
the important cities of Tralles, to the west, and Laodikeia on the Lykon, to the east. Given its important location, surprisingly little is known 
today about Antioch in the Hellenistic period; there is little mention of the city in contemporary literature and epigraphy, and the site remains 
unexcavated. In contrast, the city took on a much more important role in the Roman period, when it was fortified, and figured significantly in 
many emperors&apos; eastern campaigns. 

Its strategic location along a major trade route certainly must have enriched the city, which grew to a considerable size by the first century 
AD, spanning both sides of the Maeander (cf. Strabo 13.4.15). While the Roman provincial coinage at Antioch is quite sizable, the Hellenistic 
civic coinage is quite rare. All the civic issues date from the 2nd-1st centuries BC, and primarily consists of bronze coins, with very rare issues 
of silver tetradrachms and drachms. The types are fairly consistent across all denominations, with the obverse featuring the portrait of either 
Zeus or Apollo, with the reverse featuring a zebu bull or (very rarely) an eagle standing on a thunderbolt. Interestingly, some of the coins bear 
the name of a magistrate, while others do not. 

The silver is all traditionally dated to the 2nd century BC, and may have begun with a couple rare issues of Alexander type tetradrachms that 
M.J. Price (following H. Seyrig) tentatively placed there, circa 190-180 BC, but it is more likely that they are issues of Tabai (cf. Price p. 311). 
No Seleukid issues are currently attributed to Antioch, but there are many western issues that are unattributed from the reigns of Antiochos I 
through Antiochos III, so it is possible that some of these issues may actually belong to this city. The present piece is a stephanophoric type 
tetradrachm -a type known in only four examples for this city. If it was struck alongside the other stephanophoroi in western Asia Minor in 
the mid-2nd century BC, this tetradrachm may be the earliest of the city&apos;s silver; it notably bears the longer legend &quot;Of the people of Antioch 
by the Maeander,&quot; rather than the usual &quot;Of the people of Antioch&quot; that is canonical on the all other Hellenistic issues of Antioch.

The portraits on coins in the later Lycian series are among the finest of the Classical period. Among the earliest to attempt depictions of 
their rulers on coinage, the Lycians&apos; first portraits in the later 5th century BC were innovative, but static, idealized forms lacking individual 
characterization. Over the next half-century, however, the style progressed significantly toward realism, culminating in the issues of the 
dynasts Mithrapata and Perikles in the early-mid 4th century BC. The coins of Mithrapata came first, depicting on their reverse the profile 
portrait of a man with distinctive elderly features. Through the relative chronology established in L. Mildenberg&apos;s die study, one can even 
see the portrait become more aged as time progressed, reflecting the realism that had been captured in these issues. The coins of Perikles, 
Mithrapata&apos;s successor, continue this trend, but also have two innovations that set them at the pinnacle of classical portraiture. First, the 
portrait is moved to the obverse of the coin, emphasizing the importance of the individual. Second, and most prominently, the portrait is not 
in the traditional profile, but in a dramatic facing state. Obviously influenced by Kimon&apos;s facing Arethusa-head coinage at Syracuse, these 
depict Perikles looking out from the surface of the coin with a serene countenance and his hair flowing around him as if blown by the wind. 
This depiction captures the essence of the earlier idealized portraits, conveying to the viewer a sense that Perikles was more than a mere man, 
but retaining the realism in its individualized features. Interestingly, both Mithrapata and Perikles are depicted without any sort of satrapal 
headgear, which was always included in earlier Lycian portraits, perhaps indicating that they had declared their independence from the Persian 
king. These astonishing developments in portraiture came to an abrupt end in Lycia when Maussollos of Caria invaded the region circa 360 
BC.

($10,000) 

This stunning issue was first discovered in a small group of coins found circa 1970 that M.J. Price and N. Waggoner thought was likely 
another parcel from the Asyut Hoard. The authors suggested the coin was from the Cypriot mint of Lapethos based on an issue of that mint 
that has roughly similar types (cf. Larnaca Hoard 458-30). The coin was further analyzed by O. Masson in his RN 1982 article, &quot;Notes de 
numismatique Chypriote&quot; (pp. 14-6), in which he accepted Price and Troxell&apos;s attribution, and suggested that the epigraphy referred to a king 
named &apos;B[D]-(or &apos;abd-), for which there are possibilities at various locations on Cyprus. Price and Waggoner had found the inscription 
&quot;vague&quot;, but suggested that it was perhaps Baal written in retrograde. The coin was again discussed by J.H. Kagan in the context of discussing 
a hoard of archaic coins that included two staters with a nearly identical obverse type as here, but lacking any legend and paired with a 
reverse featuring the forepart of a winged, man-headed bull right in an incuse (J.H. Kagan, &quot;An Archaic Greek coin hoard from the Eastern 
Mediterranean and early Cypriot coinage&quot; in NC 154 [1994], pp. 17-52, at 36 [Kagan also notes that one of these winged-bull staters was 
present in the archaic Demanhur Hoard (IGCH 1637)]). Kagan accepted an attribution to an uncertain mint on Cyprus, though he was not 
convinced of the connection to the Lapethos issues noted by Price and Waggoner. Two fractions, a third and a sixth stater, have since come 
to light that must be associated with the present coin, both featuring obverses with the exact same type as here, but with rough incuse squares 
on their reverse (see references above). While no legend is visible on the third stater, the sixth stater appears to have the Aramaic letters B&apos; 
above, and another B&apos; in the left field, flanking the lower wing (though the second letter is partially off the flan). 

The attribution of these issues to a mint on Cyprus, though, is untenable for many reasons. First, the association of the issue with the Lapethos 
coins is very weak. The obverses are certainly of very different figures, though their poses are somewhat similar. The reverse type is found 
on many coinages elsewhere -a popular type that was replicated on a number of disparate issues. Second, none of the known provenances 
for any of these coins is a location on Cyprus -two are in Egypt, Asyut and Demanhur, while the third is thought to be from a site in Cilicia, 
Syria, or Phoenicia. Third, all of these hoards contained coins from various mints, and none are of exclusively Cypriot composition. Fourth, 
characteristics of the flan -thick and compact in manufacture -is rather inconsistent with early Cypriot issues. The coins of Euelthon are 
the most similar, but even these have flans that are consistently more flat and spread. In contrast, many early coins of southern Asia Minor, 
Syria, and Phoenicia have this type of flan. Fifth, the form of the incuse, with portions of the sides of the square extending into the fields, 
is not present on any Cypriot issues, but is known on coins of Lycia (cf. Asyut 249-51) and an uncertain mint likely in southern Asia Minor 
or Syria (cf. Triton XXI, lot 515, and Savoca 19, lot 96). As such, it seems more likely that this coin is an issue from southern Asia Minor, 
particularly so if the issues with the forepart of a winged, man-headed bull are from the same series, as that reverse type is well known on 
issues in Caria, Lycia, and Cilicia. 

Finally, the identification of the types has also probably been incorrect. The figure on the obverse has traditionally been identified as a Gorgon, 
which would make this issue unique for the fact that it would be the only Greek issue depicting the full figure of a Gorgon, rather than just 
its head. Admittedly, the facing head with its protruding tongue is identical to the form of Gorgon heads commonly found on early coins, but 
other characteristics of the figure suggest it is not a Gorgon. For one, the figure has four straight wings, depicted in a style that is the norm for 
eastern deities, but is unknown for Gorgons. There are rare early vases that do depict Medusa with four wings, but they are quite different in 
their representation (cf. Attic black figure amphora Paris N1020 or F230, in the Louvre). The most salient feature discounting the figure as a 
Gorgon has been completely overlooked before -the figure has a tail -a feature that is not a part of any ancient representation of a Gorgon, 
nor is a Gorgon ever described as having one in ancient literature. It is thus more likely that the obverse depicts a local representation of Ba&apos;al, 
as noted by the legend on the coins. If this is correct, it is also likely that the reverse type does not depict Herakles, as previously described, 
but the eastern deity associated with him, Melkart.

The Trophy coinage of Susa began circa 300 BC, in the aftermath of the pivotal Battle of Ipsos, ending the Fourth Diadoch War, which saw 
the final defeat of Seleukos&apos; most formidable enemy, Antigonos I Monophthalmos, whose power in Asia Minor posed the greatest threat to the 
nascent Seleukid empire. Traditionally, this coinage was thought to have begun slightly earlier, marking the successful end of Seleukos&apos; Indian 
campaign in 305 BC, but a recent analysis of the iconography recognized that the details of the trophy indicated that a Macedonian enemy 
was defeated; the star on the shield was an Argead device, which clearly identifies the vanquished opponent as the Antigonid enemy that fell at 
Ipsos (see P. Iossif, &quot;Les monnaies de Suse frappées par Séleucos Ier: Une nouvelle approche&quot; in QT XXXIII [2004], pp. 249-71). The portrait 
on the obverse has long been the subject of debate, with numismatists identifying him as Dionysos, Alexander, or Seleukos. The arguments 
for each identification have merit, and indeed they are probably all correct; the image is an assimilation of all three into a singular portrait, as 
Iossif argues. In contrast to the reverse, which relates to the western victory of Seleukos, the obverse portrait relates to Seleukos&apos; eastern victory 
and ties his mythology to that of both Dionysos, the first conqueror of India, and Alexander, the second conqueror of India. Thus, this issue 
celebrates the totality of Seleukos&apos; victories in the east and west, solidifying his new empire, and also further establishes his dynastic heritage 
by tying his exploits to that of the great conqueror, Alexander, in an effort to legitimize Seleukos&apos; right to rule over these vast lands.

This must have been the first issue of tetradrachms struck by Demetrios I at Susa, and was apparently struck in urgent circumstances, as the 
mint reused a die of the previous king, Antiochos IV, rather than cut a new die with Demetrios&apos; portrait. This obverse die was previously used 
for Antiochos on tetradrachms of SC 1531 type.

This rare issue was struck to commemorate the marriage of Alexander I Balas and Kleopatra Thea in 150 BC, a union that politically united 
the Ptolemaic and Seleukid Empires. Previously thought to be a special emission of the Seleukeia in Pieria mint, based on the imagery of 
Nike holding a thunderbolt, it is now attributed to the Ptolemaïs (Ake) mint. Arthur Houghton, in his die study published in 1988, recorded 19 
specimens struck from three obverse and ten reverse dies, which indicates a short-lived and special coinage.

In the final year of Alexander I Balas&apos; reign, Demetrios II Nikator, seeking to avenge the death of his father, Demetrios I Soter, advanced 
on Alexander from Cilicia, supported by troops of Ptolemy VI of Egypt that advanced from Palestine. Alexander fled from Antioch to rally 
his forces at a chosen location to the east. Between this time and the arrival of Demetrios&apos; forces, Antioch struck a very short series of 
tetradrachms and drachms in the name of Antiochos IV. A number of the tetradrachms are dated, confirming this chronology. Although the 
drachms are undated, they also carry the three-line legend and &quot;older&quot; portrait style of the tetradrachms, both of which are not found in the 
lifetime issues of Antiochos. While the chronology is certain, the purpose of the issue remains unknown.

The Temple of Athena at Magarsos, near Mallos, was an important cult sanctuary in the Hellenistic period. The central statue of Athena 
Magarsia is known only from the handful of coins that have survived, which show a blending of Greek and eastern motifs. The town of 
Margasos is thought to have been founded in the Hittite era, and R. Lane Fox has recently analyzed the cult site in his book Travelling 
Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer (pp. 82ff). He believes that the site was established by Sennacherib, king of Assyria, in the aftermath of 
a naval victory at the mouth of the Pyramos river that flows through the town, who dedicated the shrine to the goddess Anat or Ishtar. The 
identification of the statue as Athena is thought to have been made by Alexander the Great, who made a sacrifice at the temple just prior to 
the Battle of Issos in 333 BC. 

Remarkable Discovery Coin 

330. 
SELEUKID EMPIRE. Antiochos VII Euergetes (Sidetes). 138-129 BC. AR Tetradrachm (30mm, 16.14 g, 11h). 
Posthumous issue struck under Ariarathes VII Philometor of Cappadocia. Uncertain mint in Cappadocia. Diademed head of 
Antiochos VII right / ∫Å%5¬EW% Å@t5ocoU f5¬oÂ˙toro%, Athena Nikephoros standing left; to inner left, µ above 
±. Unpublished. VF, thin find patina. Unique. 
($1000) 

In the early 2000s, A. Houghton and C. Lorber determined that large series of tetradrachms that had previously been listed as issues of 
Antiochos VII Euergetes were actually posthumous issues in his name, struck under Ariarathes VII Philometor in Cappadocia. Further 
research by E. Krengel and Lorber expanded the series to encompass the Cappadocian kings from Ariarathes VI to Ariobarzanes I. All of 
these posthumous Antiochos VII issues were of the same types as the present coin, except that the reverses had their types enclosed within a 
wreath, and featured the name and epithet of either of the two kings. The present coin is unprecedented in that the reverse omits the wreath 
and, perhaps most importantly, has paired the name of Antiochos with the epithet of Ariarathes. Placing this issue is difficult, as the obverse die 
is not connected to the other posthumous Antiochos VII issues, nor do these monograms appear together on either king&apos;s coinage (in fact, the 
upper monogram was not used by either, and the lower monogram only appears on a couple issues of Antiochos at Tarsos). One is tempted to 
speculate that this may represent an issue of another king, otherwise unknown, called Antiochos Philometoros, but this is unlikely, particularly 
given the certainty that the obverse portrait is that of Antiochos VII, and that king&apos;s sons named Antiochos never used the epithet Philometor. 
A truly remarkable discovery!

From the MNL Collection, purchased from Frank Kovacs, 25 August 2011. 

Upon the death of their older brother, Seleukos VI, in 94 BC, Antiochos XI and Philip I declared themselves joint kings, and sought revenge 
upon Antiochos X, who they saw as ultimately responsible for their sibling&apos;s murder. At first, the brothers jointly sacked the Cilician city of 
Mopsos, which had revolted against and subsequently murdered Seleukos and his lieutenants. Afterward, Philip remained in Cilicia while 
Antiochos XI led a force east to confront Antiochos X in Syria. Although he was initially successful, capturing Antioch for a brief moment, 
Antiochos XI was soon forced to flee, and he drowned while attempting to cross the Orontes. At the same time, Philip I had been enroute to 
assist his brother, and thereafter carried on the fight. 

The very short joint reign of the brothers is only known from five issues of tetradrachms, all struck in Cilicia. Each feature the same portraiture 
and reverse type, but different control marks. Three of the issues were likely struck at Tarsos, while the other two, which includes the present 
coin, were struck at a presently unknown mint. All are extremely rare today.

The Shekels of Tyre 

One of the great cities of Phoenicia, Tyre was subject to the Ptolemies and later the Seleucids, being an important mint for both dynasties. In 
126/5 BC, Tyre received a grant of autonomy from the Seleukid crown and immediately inaugurated a civic coinage dated to the new era. The 
civic silver featured an obverse head of the local god Melqart, and the reverse type of an eagle standing on a prow. Tyrian shekels and half-
shekels were minted in large numbers for nearly the next two centuries and circulated widely in nearby Judaea, where, due to their attested 
purity, they were prescribed by the Jewish authorities as the coins used by Jews to pay their annual Temple dues. In 1982, Ya&apos;akov Meshorer 
speculated that the Tyrian issues after 18 BC, nearly all with a KP mintmark, were actually struck in Jerusalem; this theory has been widely 
disputed and is now in disfavor, although it is likely the primary purpose for which the Tyrian silver coinage of the early to mid first century 
CE was struck was payment of the Temple tax. The New Testament &quot;30 pieces of silver&quot; supposedly paid to Judas for betraying Jesus would 
almost certainly have been Tyrian issues. This and the following 32 lots represent a range of dates from 18 BC to AD 65/6, the last recorded 
date of their issue.

This is the last recorded year that the shekel of Tyre was struck. Specialists in the coinage of Phoenicia and Judaea have noted that this date 
coincides with the onset of the Jewish War, when authorities at the Jerusalem Temple began striking their own silver coins for payment of 
the tax.

In his seminal work, A Treasury of Jewish Coins, Y. Meshorer identified the obverse type as God&apos;s ear (pp. 11-2), stating: &quot;In ancient forms of 
ritual and prayers to various deities, the notable relationship between man and his god was that between supplicant and listener: the supplicant 
voices his prayer and entreaties to his god, and the god listens and tries to carry out his wishes. Thus the god&apos;s most important organ was his 
ear that heard the prayer. Indeed, an appeal to the gods and an appeal to the God of Israel was to be directed to their ears, and there are many 
examples of this in the Bible, including: &apos;Incline Thine ear unto me and hear my speech&apos; (Ps. 17:6); &apos;Incline Thine ear unto me and save me&apos; 
(Ps. 71:2), and &apos;Incline Thine ear, O Lord, and answer me&apos; (Ps. 86:1).&quot;

crested Attic helmet decorated with two Udjat eyes and an olive leaf over the visor, and a spiral palmette on the bowl / Owl

second and finest known, in an earlier die state than the Israel Museum specimen. 
($75,000) 

The types of this extremely rare tetradrachm and drachm (see following lot) copy those of the famous dekadrachms of Athens and underscore 
the enormous impact that Athenian coinage had on the region. The most notable and remarkable difference in the iconography, however, is 
the presence of udjat (also referred to as wadjet) symbols along the visor of Athena&apos;s helmet, two of which appear on the tetradrachm, one 
on the drachm. Better known as the Eye of Horus, the udjat was a symbol of protection and, as such, was a frequent amulet type in ancient 
Egypt. The exact significance of the Eye of Horus symbols on the current lots is uncertain. As an apotropaic device, it was perhaps included 
to underscore Athena&apos;s role as protectress, or, as Gitler and Tal have suggested, it may relate to the goddess&apos; epithet Ophthalmitis (&quot;the sharp-
sighted&quot;). 

Fischer-Bossert and Gitler have attempted to reconstruct the 1983 Ismailiya Hoard, which is said to have contained the Israel Museum 
tetradrachm. Based on the coins that can confidently be assigned to this hoard, they date the Philistian issues contained in it to no later than 
the last quarter of the 5th century.

Portrait of Tissaphernes? 

395. 
PERSIA, Achaemenid Empire. temp. Darios II to Artaxerxes II. Circa 413-401 BC. AE (14.5mm, 3.52 g, 12h).

7636 (Sigeium mint). VF, dark green patina, some earthen deposits. Very rare, and among the finest of 14 known (Qedar notes 
eleven examples, only two additional in CoinArchives). 
($1000) 

The identification of the portrait on this coinage as the satrap Tissaphernes is still debated. Some scholars note a similarity in style between the 
portrait here and that found on bronze coins of Astyra where the satrap&apos;s name appears below the bust. Others doubt this identification, most 
notably L. Mildenberg, in his article, &quot;The So-Called Satrapal Coinage&quot; in MIMAA. Nonetheless, the location of the mint is fairly secure, as 
six of the eleven known to Qedar were found in the Dora excavations. The prior attribution by von Aulock, followed by Meadows, to Sigeion 
was merely due to his acquisition of his coin there, and the fact that owls appear on issues of that city. Although these coins appear to have been 
from an issue of bronze, the last of the eleven coins that Qedar saw had silver plating, which appeared him to be original to the coin, leading 
him to conclude that these were originally fourrée drachms. Nonetheless, the appearance of this feature on only one of the eleven also could 
suggest that that one coin was plated at some point by its owner for an unknown reason.

One of the great (and very popular) rarities for ancient gold coinage collectors is the gold stater (or daric?) issued by the Egyptian Pharaoh 
Nektanebo II. The authors of the die study cited above could account for only 42 examples struck from 3 obverse and 3 reverse dies with 
5 die combinations. They also listed 5 examples from the Mit Rahineh hoard (IGCH 1658) that they could not examine for their die study. 
The attribution to Nektanebo II is based primarily on circumstantial historical evidence and not the coins themselves, which do not bear any 
specific ethnic or monogram. 

Nekht-har-hebi, or Nektanebo II as he was known to the Greeks, was the nephew of the Pharaoh Tachos (Djedhor). Placed in command of the 
Egyptian army in Syria during the Satrapal Revolt, he turned his troops against his own king, and uncle, and took Egypt by force. In 351-350 
BC, he repelled a Persian invasion but was driven from his throne in 344-343 by a second assault. He then fled Egypt and found refuge in 
Ethiopia and retained control of Upper Egypt for another few years. 

Nektanebo most likely would have issued his gold staters to pay the mercenaries in his army. What makes the coinage of Nektanebo stand out 
is the adoption of a purely Egyptian design. This is the only known ancient coinage to employ a hieroglyph -a purely Egyptian coin.

A New Issue Struck under Ptolemy V 

410. 
PTOLEMAIC KINGS of EGYPT. Ptolemy II Philadelphos, with Arsinöe II, Ptolemy I, and Berenike I. 285-
246 BC. AV Half Mnaïeion -&apos;Tetradrachm&apos; (21mm, 13.78 g, 11h). Commemorative issue. Uncertain mint. Struck under 
Ptolemy V, circa 199/8 BC. Conjoined busts of Ptolemy II and Arsinöe II right; Ptolemy is diademed and draped, Arsinöe is 
diademed and veiled; ÅdE¬fW@ above, shield to left / Conjoined busts of Ptolemy I and Berenike I; Ptolemy is diademed

($2000) 

In 199/8 BC, there were a number of commemorative issues struck at various mints in celebration of the formal deification of Ptolemy V. These 
issues included gold mnaieia of Ptolemy V (Sv. 1254 and 1257 [Alexandreia]), silver tetradrachms of Ptolemy V (Sv. 1249 [Alexandreia, and 
prob. Sidon] and 1250 [prob. Tyre]), gold mnaieia of Arsinoe II (Sv. 1159 [Alexandreia]), and, most importantly for the present coin, gold 
mnaieia of the Theoi Adelphoi type (Sv. 613α and 1229 [Alexandreia], 1247 [prob. Sidon], and 1248 [prob. Tyre]). This new half mnaieion 
is certainly to be associated with this commemorative coinage, based on the unusual portrait styles, the presence of the star symbol, and 
the deeper concavity of the reverse-all features that set it apart from the large series struck under Ptolemy II. The question that remains 
unanswered is, from which mint? Until further evidence appears, though, it remains a mystery, though the style seems to discount any of the 
standard mints, but many small mints became active during the reign of Ptolemy V, some of which had not previously struck precious metal 
issues. [CNG thanks Cathy Lorber for providing comments and evidence for this piece, upon which this note is based.]

Ascending the throne at the age of 5 or 6 in 204 BC, Ptolemy V Epiphanes faced a kingdom in crisis: A native Egyptian uprising under a rebel 
Pharaoh controlled much of Upper Egypt, the government of Alexandria was paralyzed by infighting between rival courtiers, and the Seleukid 
and Macedonian kingdoms launched invasions of Egypt&apos;s outlying provinces. Despite these travails, the young king was honored by a new 
effusion of coinage that, unusually for the Ptolemaic series, bore his own portrait, rather than that of the dynasty&apos;s founder. This included gold 
mnaieia (worth 100 silver drachms) with a dramatic radiate portrait of Ptolemy V shouldering a spear. The bust, wearing the solar crown of 
Helios, recalls a similar portrayal of his grandfather Ptolemy III on gold mnaieons struck during the previous reign, while the spear alludes to 
the martial temper of the times. The two stars on the reverse may refer to a pair of comets that marked the king&apos;s birth and his ascension to the 
throne. The extreme rarity of this issue today indicates the gold was struck only sparingly and supplemented by contemporary issues depicting 
his father Ptolemy IV, his mother Arsinoe III, and a re-issue of the familiar Theoi Adelphoi mnaieons depicting the first four Ptolemaic rulers. 
In contrast, silver tetradrachms bearing Ptolemy V&apos;s diademed portrait were issued both at Alexandreia and branch mints, primarily Tyre, 
Phoenicia, in considerable quantities (see next lot).

This exceptional piece is from a very rare series from the mint of Soli, which represents the only group from the large Serapis and Isis coinage 
that can be definitively dated to the reign of Ptolemy V. This series at Soli is composed of three issues, all of which share a common obverse 
die and have an MO in the left field of the reverse. Two magistrates, AP and ON, appear in the right field of the reverse. A subsidiary control 
mark, an owl, appears with both magistrates, though one issue of ON lacks this control. The two studies of this series reconstructed the order 
of the issues as AP-with-owl, ON-without-owl, and ON-with-owl. However, this was predicated upon an erroneous identification of the state 
of the common obverse die that was used. While the two coins with AP-owl are clearly of the earliest state, a close comparison of the two ON 
coins reveals that the die state of the obverse on the ON-without-owl coin (in the ANS) is clearly later than that of the ON-with-owl coin (the 
present piece). This rearrangement is confirmed by another oversight of the previous studies, that the ON-with-owl coin is struck from the 
same reverse die as the AP-with-owl coin, but with the ON now re-engraved over the AP. Thus, the correct arrangement of the three issues 
must be AP-with-owl, ON-with-owl, and then ON-without-owl.

One of the more infamous Ptolemaic rulers, Ptolemy VIII Euergetes, nicknamed Physcon (&quot;Pot Belly&quot;), cut a bloody swath to gain and retain 
the throne of Egypt. One of three children of Ptolemy V Epiphanes, Physcon ruled jointly with his siblings in various arrangements, sometimes 
harmonious but usually contentious, from 170 BC to 145 BC, when his brother Ptolemy VI was killed in battle. To gain absolute power, he 
tricked his sister Cleopatra II into a very Ptolemaic sibling marriage, then murdered her son and married her daughter, Cleopatra III, creating a 
rather awkward and tempestuous menage a trois that led to civil war and further familial bloodletting. Circa 139 BC, Physcon took the unusual 
step of placing his own portrait on silver tetradrachms issued at the mint of Paphos on Cyprus. The bloated radiate portrait recalls similar 
issues in gold of his namesake Ptolemy III Euergetes, who shared his portly physique. An entertaining dramatization of this deeply decadent 
reign is available via the 1980s BBC TV series The Ptolemies, watchable on YouTube.

Apart from the substantial coinage struck on his behalf, little more is known about the local Baktrian dynast Sophytes. An attempt has been 
made to associate him with the Sopeithes of Diodorus Siculus (17.91-94), named as a northern Indian king who, as a young man, fought 
against Alexander during the Indian campaign of circa 325 BC. The Sophytes coinage, however, is much later, struck circa 280-270 BC, and 
inter-connected with two earlier groups: the Athenian imitations of tetradrachms, drachms and hemidrachms, and the Eagle group, both of 
which were published by Nicolet-Pierre and Amandry. Like the trophy issue of Seleukos I, minted two decades earlier, the Sophytes coins, 
with his name on on the reverse, show a helmeted portrait. The obvious differences between the two nevertheless belies the similarity in the 
images they project, suggesting that Sophytes was consciously modeling his own portrait after that of Seleukos I, making it the first Baktrian 
portrait coin.

The attribution of the Antiochos on this stater has been the subject of much discussion. The name suggests one of the early Seleukid kings of 
that name, and attempts have been made to associate the Antiochos here with Antiochos II, who is named on the issues of Diodotos I. Jens 
Jakobsson (&quot;Antiochus Nicator, the Third King of Baktria?&quot;, NC 170 [2010], p. 25), while rightly arguing against Antiochos II as the person 
commemorated, offered no alternative. Brian Kritt, who recently has revisited the issue (New Discoveries in Bactrian Numismatics, Chapter 
5), convincingly suggests Antiochos III as the mostly likely candidate. Antiochos III, whose historical epithet is Megas (the Great), conducted 
a vigorous series of campaigns in the East, including the subjugation of the Parthians, his victories in Bactria, including the capture of Aï 
Khanoum, and his subsequent campaigning in India (p. 80). Thus, Antiochos would have been a figure worthy of emulation and with whom 
Diodotos I would wish to be associated.

The unusual elephant headdress worn by Demetrios recalls that of Alexander on early tetradrachms of Ptolemaic Egypt. The headgear clearly 
refers to Alexander&apos;s conquests in northern India. Demetrios campaigned in India while serving a long apprenticeship under his father, 
Euthydemos I, as recorded on a dedicatory stone recently discovered north of Ai Khanoum in Afghanistan. After succeeding to the throne, 
he launched an invasion of Northern India that extended Greek control into modern Pakistan. The historian Strabo claims &quot;more tribes were 
subdued by [Demetrios] than Alexander.&quot; He apparently made Taxila in the Punjab his capital, and during his reign the Greco-Baktrian 
kingdom reached its greatest extent.

Pantaleon, whose portrait coinage in silver is exceptionally rare, also struck coins in cupro-nickel. The only place this metal could have 
come from is China, where it was known as &quot;white copper.&quot; This points to a flourishing trade between Baktria and China. Pantaleon and his 
contemporaries Euthydemos II and Agathokles are the only rulers to have struck cupro-nickel coinage until the 20th Century.

Based on the similarity of coin types, Agathokles was possibly the brother of Pantaleon, or, more probably, Pantaleon&apos;s co-ruler and immediate 
successor. Aside from his coinage, no other records or accounts of Agathokles&apos; reign survive. In addition to his portrait coins, he minted an 
extensive series of &quot;pedigree&quot; coins touting his connection to illustrious rulers of the past, including Alexander, Diodotos, Euthydemos, 
Demetrios and Pantaleon. His excellent portrait coinage depicts a rather sharp-featured man with a bit of a mad gleam in his eye.

Thanks to his coinage, the genial face of Antimachos is more familiar to us than the visages of many Hellenistic rulers, although only a single 
surviving tax receipt provides any other evidence for his reign. The distinctive head gear he sports is a kausia, a Macedonian sun hat, showing 
his connection to the distant homeland of his race. The most unusual feature of his nomenclature is the epithet Theos, &quot;God,&quot; unusual even in 
an era of grandiose titles and egos, and incongruous juxtaposed to the king&apos;s very human portrait. Another mystery is the presence of Poseidon, 
god of the sea, as Baktria was almost entirely land-locked. Since Poseidon was also the god of earthquakes, his appearance here may be an 
appeal for protection.

True to his self-granted title, Eukratides Megas was undoubtedly greatest of the Greco-Baktrian kings. Reigning circa 170-145 BC, his vast 
realm was larger than any other Greek-ruled kingdom of the time. Its wealth was stupendous, judging by the number of his surviving coins. 
Among the most dramatic issues was this remarkable type depicting the king heroically nude, his muscled back turned toward the viewer in 
a contrapposto pose, brandishing a spear. The portrait, rendered in sculptural high relief, exemplifies the virtuosity achieved by the artisans 
of this far-flung Greek enclave.

On these remarkable &quot;pedigree&quot; tetradrachms, Eukratides pairs a portrait of himself with dual portraits named as Heliokles and Laodike. 
Heliokles is shown bareheaded, while Laodike appears to wear a royal diadem. The usual interpretation is that these are the parents of 
Eukratides, although recently it has been suggested Heliokles is one of his sons and Laodike his royal bride. The issue is a puzzling one, and it 
is not even known for certain which side is the obverse and which the reverse. The bare head of Heliokles indicates he is not a king or co-ruler, 
while Laodike is clearly royal. Was he a mere satrap or general, and she the daughter of a previous Baktrian king, perhaps Euthydemos or 
Demetrios I? Or was she a princess of the Seleukid ruling dynasty (the name Laodike being quite common among the women of this house)? 
Pending the discovery of some parchment of inscription that clarifies his lineage, we cannot but guess.

Like most Indo-Greek rulers, Philoxenos &quot;The Invincible&quot; is unknown to history aside from his coinage. He struck extremely rare coins on 
the Attic standard and a much larger bilingual issue on the reduced Indian standard; these are found primarily in the Punjab and Gandhara, 
where his reign seems to have been centered. The scarcity of his coinage indicates his reign must have been brief. Bopearachchi dates his reign 
to circa 100-95 BC; HGC 9 dates it somewhat earlier, 125-110 BC. The obverse of this rare issue is clearly modeled on the great &quot;heroic&quot; 
tetradrachms of Eukratides, with the addition of an elaborate aegis over his lead shoulder.

One of the rarest reverse types in all of Kushan coinage, Ahuramazda (ahura [lord or mighty] and mazda [spirit or intelligence]) was the sole 
creator of heaven and earth and all life, and the supreme deity in the Zoroastrian pantheon. As the creator and upholder of the concept of asha 
(truth or right[eousness]), Ahuramazda was the supporter and guardian of justice and ally of the just man. As such, he became the protective 
divinity of the Achaemenids and the rulers of Persis (where he is depicted as a profile bust set into a quasi-Egyptian winged solar disk), as 
well as the Sasanian kings, who included him in the obverse legend of their coins (mzd&apos;ysn&lt;/&gt; [the Mazda worshipper]). Beginning with the 
Achaemenids, Ahuramazda became associated with the god Mithra and the goddess Anahita. While Mithra (as Miiro and Mioro) and Anahita 
(as Ardoxsho) were regularly incorporated into the pantheon of Kushan deities depicted on their coinage, the appearance of Ahuramazda on 
Kushan coins is rare. Given his hieratic importance, one might expect him to appear more frequently, given his connection to royalty. It is 
possible, however, that the Kushans were hesitant to include the supreme god on such a secular object as coinage (the same hesitancy occurred 
with issues of the Buddha), where, as John H. Rosenfield noted (p.83) &quot;less exalted elements of the pantheon would be more congenial.&quot;

($100,000) 

Between AD 233/4 and AD 238/9, Ardaxšīr (Ardashir) I, now undisputed ruler, instituted from his capital at Ctesiphon a new series of coinage, 
which featured him wearing close-fitting headdress with korymbos and proclaiming him as &quot;king of kings of Iran, descended from the gods. 
While the majority of this new series consisted of silver drachms and fractions, Ardaxšīr also issued gold coins for the first time. A dinar, its 
fraction, and a double dinar were all struck in limited quantities. This gold is unusual for, except for the issue of Andragoras and the controversial 
Parthian and Persis gold issues, these coins were the first to be struck by the the Persians since the time of the Achaemenids. To some extent, 
the dinar and its fraction would eventually come to serve the same function for the Sasanians that it did with other contemporary states, in 
transacting large scale payments. However, like other regional states that issued such coinage, gold coins, especially larger denominations 
such as this double dinar provided opportunities for the ruler to enhance his power and prestige by presenting these coins as gifts to special 
friends and worthy subjects (see, for example, the gold dekadrachms of Amyntas or the double dinars of Vima Kadphises). Eventually, the 
presentation pieces might be recalled by the issuing authority, hence the extreme rarity of these larger gold denominations, such as this coin.

Claudius was unlucky in marriage, but his third wife caused him the most scandal. Messalina was only 14 or 15 when she married the emperor, 
who at the time was about 50 years old. Although she bore Claudius two children (Claudia Octavia and Britannicus), she appears to have felt 
little attraction to her much older husband and was notoriously promiscuous according to ancient accounts. While the emperor was traveling 
to Ostia in AD 48, he was informed that Messalina had secretly taken a second husband, a senator named Gaius Silius, who was said to be the 
handsomest man in Rome. Claudius returned to Rome and swiftly had Silius executed. Messalina was ordered to commit suicide. 

No Imperial issues with the portrait of Messalina were struck. As for the small number of Provincial issues that carry her portrait, only her 
coins of Crete and Caesarea in Cappadocia match the artistry of the Imperial coinage.

The Bosporan Kingdom, occupying the northern coastline of the Black Sea and coastal areas around the Sea of Azov, was the longest-lived 
of all Hellenistic Kingdoms, lasting nearly 800 years from the fifth century BC to the later fourth century AD. With an economy based on 
trade in precious metals, grain, fish and slaves, the kingdom had a native population mixing a multitude of ethnicities under a veneer of 
Greek languague and culture. From the later first century BC, the Bosporan Kingdom could be described as a Roman &quot;client state,&quot; but the 
relationship was less subordinate than symbiotic, with the Bosporan kings requiring Roman assent to rule, and Rome relying heavily on the 
kings to protect the vulnerable northern frontier from hostile incursions by the Scythians and Sarmatians. Starting with the reign of Polemo I 
(15/14 BC-AD 9/10), the Bosporan gold coinage typically depicted the Roman Emperor and his relations and/or co-rulers.

As patron deity of Aegeae, which was renowned for its doctors, the appearance of Asclepius is not surprising, but the type must also allude 
to Caracalla&apos;s well being. The emperor&apos;s health had declined precipitously in the final years of his reign. On his way to campaign in the east 
in AD 214, he visited the great shrine of Asclepius at Pergamum in hopes of finding a cure. This visit was commemorated with a remarkable 
series of medallions issued at Pergamum, and around the same time Asclepius was honored on Caracalla&apos;s imperial coinage. The exact 
circumstances which led to this rare tetradrachm being struck at Aegeae are unknown. It is possible that Caracalla visited the important port 
town on his journey east.

The Michel Prieur Collection 

Michel Prieur (1955-2014) was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris, and spent much of his 
childhood in Africa and the Middle East. In 1988, he founded Compagnie Générale de Bourse (cgb. 
fr), the largest numismatic firm in France. Michel combined a scholarly approach to numismatics with 
a passion for promoting the hobby. He was a pioneer in ushering numismatics into the digital age, and 
was extremely proud of his website, which is available in a staggering seven languages and offers a 
wealth of information for collectors through their archives, blog, and monthly online newsletter Le 
Bulletin Numismatique. Michel authored numerous articles on French coins and banknotes, and was 
co-author of the Le Franc, a popular reference modeled on Whitman&apos;s &quot;Red Book.&quot; 

To collectors of ancient coins, Michel is best known for his publication of A type corpus of the Syro-
Phoenician tetradrachms and their fractions from 57 BC to AD 253 (Lancaster, PA, 2000), which he 
co-authored with Karin Prieur. This corpus built on decades of active research and careful recording 
of the series, and will long remain the standard reference on this often-complicated series. Michel was 
always extraordinarily generous with his time and knowledge of this series, and personally assisted 
this cataloger on a number of occasions. 

Readers will take notice that many of the following lots from the collection have been cited and/or illustrated in publications, not only in 
Prieur&apos;s own book but in Roman Provincial Coinage Vol. III and Richard McAlee&apos;s Coinage of Roman Antioch, among others. Bidders are 
also encouraged to view lots 278, 281, 344, 345, 365, 373, 374, and 376 in the Greek section of this sale for additional coins from the Prieur 
Collection.

A great rarity of the Syro-Phoenician tetradrachm series and one of only a few so-called &quot;presentation issues&quot; to honor Julia Domna. 
Commenting on this type, Prieur notes: &quot;There is an interesting parallel between the representation of the empress as Selene, with her bust 
over a crescent, and the newly introduced antoniniani. When Caracalla and Julia Domna left Rome in early 214 for Antioch, they decided upon 
the creation of the antoninianus...this may explain the use of this obverse for the presentation issue.&quot;

Lucian of Samosata describes in detail the Hierapolitan cult images of Haddad and Atargatis (whom he refers to as Zeus and Hera) in his De 
Dea Syria (31-33), a &quot;guidebook&quot; of sorts to the deities&apos; temple in Hierapolis and the cult practices taking place there. His description of the 
statues of Atargatis, Haddad, and the mysterious &quot;symbol&quot; comports wonderfully with the figures as they appear on this type: 

The great temple is open to all; the sacred shrine to the priests alone and not to all of these, but only to those who are deemed nearest to the 
gods and who have the charge of the entire administration of the sacred rites. In this shrine are placed the statues, one of which is Hera, 
the other Zeus, though they call him by another name. Both of these are golden, both are sitting; Hera is supported by lions, Zeus is sitting 
on bulls...between the two there stands another image of gold, no part of it resembling the others. This possesses no special form of its own, 
but recalls the characteristics of other gods. The Assyrians themselves speak of it as a symbol (Greek σημεῖον), but they have assigned it 
no definite name. They have nothing to tell us about its origin, nor its form: some refer to it as Dionysus; others to Deukalion; others to 
Semiramis; for its summit is crowned by a golden pigeon, and this is why they allege it is the effigy of Semiramis.

and Haddad. The statue is only briefly discussed by Lucian of Samosata (De Dea Syria 35), but Macrobius (Saturnalia I.17.66-67) describes 
it in much greater detail, informing us that Apollo wore a calathus, pointy beard, and cuirass, and held a lance and flower.

Antioch, Principal Roman Mint in the East 

Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch served as the three principal mints throughout much of the history of the Roman Empire. Production at 
the mint of Antioch, however, is by far the most complex. At various periods under Rome&apos;s rule, Antioch struck aurei, denarii, antoniniani, 
tetradrachms and their fractions, and a variety of base metal denominations, with much of their &quot;provincial&quot; coinage functioning as regional 
issues rather than civic (i.e., they lack an ethnic and circulated widely throughout the region). Moreover, Antioch appears to have struck civic 
coins for other cities in the 3rd century, and other mints participated in the production of &quot;Syrian&quot; tetradrachms that are frequently designated 
Antiochene. Unraveling productivity at this mint is complex, to say the least, and scholarly advancement is ongoing. For the sake of simplicity, 
we have kept the following lots under their traditional attribution of Antioch, with commentary on alternative attributions accompanying the 
descriptions. 

Gabinius, Legate to Pompey

SELEUCIS and PIERIA, Antioch. Aulus Gabinius. 57-55 BC. AR Tetradrachm (28mm, 15.40 g, 12h). In the

By the time Aulus Gabinius became tribune of the plebs in 67 BC, Cilician pirates had overrun the eastern Mediterranean as the major 
dynasties that had ruled over the territory since the death of Alexander the Great fell into decline. Although Rome saw steep inflation and 
even faced famine as a result, the Senate was reluctant to assign any one commander to deal with the issue as they feared this would grant 
too much power to a single individual. With unrest against the Senate reaching a tipping point, the tribune Aulus Gabinius was able to push 
through his Lex Gabinia de piratis persequendis, which authorized Pompey to wage war on the pirates, effectively placing the commander 
in control of the East. 

Gabinius subsequently served as legate to Pompey and was integral in mediating in affairs in Mesopotamia and Judaea. He became pronconsul 
of Syria in 57 BC, during which time he reorganized Judaea and rebuilt a number of cities, while squashing revolts led by Aristobolus and 
Alexander Jannaeus and reinstating Hyrcanus II as high priest. In 55 BC, Pompey instructed Gabinius to lead his troops to Egypt to restore 
Ptolemy XII, an ally of the Romans, after the king was expelled and replaced by his sister Berenice. This move would prove fateful, as he 
left Syria for Egypt by order of Pompey but without the consent of the Senate. As a result, he was charged with treason but was acquitted. 
The Senate did, however, find him guilty of extortion for his acceptance of 10,000 talents from Ptolemy as payment for restoring him to the 
Egyptian throne. Gabinius&apos; was sent into exile, but was recalled by Julius Caesar in 49 BC. He died of illness in circa 47 BC at Salona (modern 
Solin, Croatia, a short distance from Split).

Gaius Cassius Longinus took part in the campaign against Parthia that culminated in the Battle of Carrhae, one of Rome&apos;s most humiliating 
military losses, where he served as quaestor to the general Marcus Licinius Crassus. When Crassus was killed in the battle, Cassius retreated 
to Syria with the remaining Roman army and assumed the governorship from 53-51, at which time this rare series of tetradrachms was struck. 
He returned to Rome in 50 BC amidst the growing conflict between Julius Caesar and Pompey, choosing to serve as naval commander for 
the latter. Caesar eventually pardoned Cassius and even appointed him legate. Despite Caesar&apos;s clemency, Cassius became one of the chief 
architects in the plot to assassinate the dictator perpetuo in March of 44 BC. Two years later, following his defeat at Philippi, Cassius took his 
own life with the same dagger that he used to stab Caesar.

From the Collection of a Northern California Gentleman. Purchased from Frank Kovacs, May 1993. 

The obverse legend is usually translated as &quot;Queen Cleopatra, the younger goddess&quot; or &quot;...the newer goddess.&quot; Ted Buttrey (&quot;Thea Neotera,&quot; 
MN VI [1954], pp. 95-109) read the legend rather differently: &quot;Queen Cleopatra Thea, junior.&quot; Essentially, this would make her Cleopatra Thea 
II and thus the namesake of the Seleucid queen Cleopatra Thea (ruled 125-121 BC), the daughter of Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II. Buttrey argued 
that such tetradrachms of Antony and Cleopatra officially mark Cleopatra as reigning &quot;...not as Egyptian conquerer but as a Seleucid queen.&quot; 
While traditionally given to the Antioch mint, such an attribution is by no means certain. The authors of RPC (pp. 601-2) doubted this theory 
and stated &quot;...the portraits might suggest that one should look for a mint further south in Cleopatra&apos;s &apos;Phoenician&apos; kingdom; an alternative 
explanation might be that they were made on the move by Antony, after wintering in Antioch 37/36.&quot;

This coin belongs to a class of Julio-Claudian &quot;Zeus tetradrachms&quot; that have been variously attributed. Seyrig (Syria 20 [1939], p. 39) was 
the first to propose Tarsus as the place where they were struck, but RPC (p. 604) rejected this attribution as other Augustan and Tiberian 
tetradrachms, of different style and of a higher silver content, specifically carry the TAP ethnic on their reverses (see lot 513 above). It is 
suggested there that the &quot;Zeus tetradrachms&quot; were perhaps struck at Laodicea in Syria or more likely an uncertain mint in Cilicia. McAlee (p. 
128) argues that the attribution to Tarsus should not be dismissed, noting that the mint of Antioch also struck coins of differing style and silver 
content, while stressing the stylistic similarities between the &quot;Zeus tetradrachms&quot; and bronze coinage of Tarsus.

There is considerable variation in both the style and fabric of Flavian tetradrachms traditionally assigned to Antioch, and scholars have long 
suspected that multiple mints were participating in their production. Stylistically, Kraay divided them between four possible mints (Antioch, 
a mint under the influence of Antioch, Tripolis[?], and Tyre); McAlee between five (Antioch, Tripolis[?], Aradus[?], Caesarea Maritima, 
and Tyre); and Butcher three (Antioch, Caesarea Maritima, and Alexandria). Moreover, these theories beg further questions: were the coins 
actually struck at the proposed mints, did mint workers from these cities travel to Antioch, or were the dies produced at these mints and sent 
to Antioch?

for this year are similar to that seen on &quot;Judaea Capta&quot; bronze coins, and it is has been suggested that these tetradrachms were struck at the

Tetradrachm Production under Elagabalus 
Antioch or Emesa?

($300) 

From the Michel Prieur Collection. 

Under Elagabalus, tetradrachm production became, with the exception of some Mesopotamian issues, consolidated at a single location. This 
mint has traditionally been identified as Antioch, but such an attribution is by no means certain, and Emesa and Laodicea have also been 
suggested as possibilities. Emesa, as the hometown of Elagabalus and cult center of his patron deity, is a strong candidate; many of Elagabalus&apos; 
tetradrachms show stylistic similarities to previous Emesene issues, and it is interesting that Emesa had already served as the principal mint for 
Macrinus&apos; tetradrachm production. McAlee also points to the current type, with its unusual left-facing bust type with hand raised, as possible 
evidence that Elagabalus&apos; tetradrachms were struck at Emesa; a very similar bust type was replicated on tetradrachms of Uranius Antoninus, 
whose coinage was certainly struck there.

The exergual legend can be expanded to MONeta VRBis. Rome was colloquially know as Urbs (&quot;the city&quot;), and Moneta Urbis can be 
understood as meaning &quot;Roman money&quot; or &quot;Roman mint.&quot; H.R. Baldus was the first to put forth the now widely accepted view that these 
coins were struck at Rome or, at the very least, the dies were prepared there. McAlee (p. 325) notes: &quot;The use of the genitive case for Philip&apos;s 
name (meaning &apos;of Philip&apos;) may indicate that this was a special issue under Philip&apos;s personal authority, although this seems at odds with the 
presence of the letters &apos;SC&apos; on the coins, indicating approval by a broader authority (theoretically, at least, the Senate).&quot;

Julia Domna is featured prominently on the tetradrachms of Emesa as the city was the empress&apos; birthplace. 

The Severan tetradrachms of Emesa carry various letters and symbols that presumably indicate officinae, but whose precise significance is 
not understood. It cannot be assumed that the &quot;A&quot; marking on this coin indicates that it is the product of the first officina as other letters, 
particularly &quot;O,&quot; were certainly not intended as numerals (O = 70).

Uranius Antoninus is unknown from the ancient literary sources, although Zosimus perhaps confuses him with two usurpers he names as 
Uranius and Antoninus during the reign of Severus Alexander. Uranius Antoninus established his government at Emesa, probably in response 
to repeated Persian attacks rather than as a challenge to Rome. In any event, it appears he was finally subdued when Valerian marched to 
recover the East.

Continued Herodian support of the Romans allowed the dynasty to extend its influence beyond Jewish territories. Herod V, the grandson of 
Herod the Great, was granted the kingdom of Chalkis by Claudius in 41 upon the request of Agrippa I, and all of Herod&apos;s rare coins name 
the emperor. His friendship with and loyalty to the emperor continued to benefit him; following the death of Agrippa in 44, Claudius granted 
Herod authority over affairs at the Temple in Jerusalem, a right he retained until his death some four years later.

Astarte, a Syro-Phoenician goddess of fertility, sexuality and war, derived from the Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar and was known in other 
cultures as Asthart and Ashtoreth. She was worshipped in Phoenicia in the form of a baetyl, an aniconic stone cult image. In many cases the 
baetyl was believed to have fallen from the heavens and would be known today as a meteorite. Perhaps indicative of this connection, here the 
baetyl is shown on its sacred cart in the center of a Zodiacal ring. The heavenly Zodiacal belt was divided into 12 sections containing the major 
constellations and planets, whose movements were thought to guide the affairs of humans and gods alike.

Cadmus Introduces the Alphabet to the Greeks 
Finest Known Example of Type 

729. 
PHOENICIA, Tyre. Philip I. AD 244-249. AE (29mm, 18.88 g, 6h). IMP M IVL PHILLIP[V]S P F AVG, laureate, 
draped, and cuirassed bust right / COL TV-RO ME-T-ROP, Cadmus presenting the alphabet to the Hellenes: Cadmus standing 
left, holding spear in left hand, with right hand he presents a rolled papyrus to the first of four Greeks standing right; murex 
shell at Cadmus&apos; feet, ЄΛΛH and KAΔ in exergue. Rouvier 2446 = Babelon, Perses 2281; BMC -; AUB -. Good VF, red-

($15,000) 

It is generally accepted that the Greeks adopted the Phoenician alphabet around the early 8th century BC, although Herodotus records that the 
Phoencian prince Cadmus introduced the alphabet to the Hellenes circa 2000 BC. This extremely rare and highly interesting issue explicitly 
names the figures and represents the legend as recorded in Herodotus 5.58: 

The Phoenicians who came with Cadmus-amongst whom were the Gephyraei-introduced into Greece, after their settlement in the country, 
a number of accomplishments, of which the most important was writing, an art till then, I think, unknown to the Greeks. At first they used the 
same characters as all the other Phoenicians, but as time went on, and they changed their language, they also changed the shape of their 
letters. At that period most of the Greeks in the neighborhood were Ionians; they were taught these letters by the Phoenicians and adopted 
them, with a few alterations, for their own use, continuing to refer to them as the Phoenician characters-as was only right, as the Phoenicians 
had introduced them.

124a; RPC I 4982; for c/m: Howgego 156. Good VF, green and brown patina. Rare and of great historical importance. Possibly 
the finest known. 
($5000) 

Agrippa I had a close relationship with both Gaius (Caligula) and Claudius, in part helping to secure the rule of the latter in the uncertain 
days following his unexpected rise to the purple. Indeed, his relationship with Claudius was so close that Josephus (Ant. xix. 5.1) records that 
among the new emperor&apos;s first acts was publishing an edict guaranteeing Agrippa&apos;s kingdom (with the title &quot;Great King&quot;) and granting the 
territory of Chalcis to Agrippa&apos;s elder brother Herod. 

This remarkable and rare issue not only explicitly refers to the alliance on the reverse, even using Agrippa&apos;s new title &quot;Great King,&quot; but depicts 
the oath taking ceremony that occurred in the Roman Forum and is discussed in historical sources: 

He also made a league with this Agrippa, confirmed by oaths, in the middle of the Forum in the city of Rome. (Josephus, Ant. xix.5.1) 

He struck his treaties with foreign princes in the Forum, sacrificing a pig and reciting the ancient formula of the fetial priests. (Suetonius, 
Claud. 25.5) 

The current piece is exceptional for type, with the majority of specimens in poor condition and with much of the legends illegible. For the 
extremely rare counterpart issue of Herod of Chalcis with a similar obverse, albeit with the position of the brothers switched, see Meshorer 
361.

Burnett believed the scene on the reverse represented the consecration of the treaty between Claudius and Agrippa (see previous lot). Although 
Josephus and Suetonius place the rites of the treaty, which included the sacrifice of a pig, in the Roman Forum, Burnett argued that they instead 
took place at the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. Following Burnett&apos;s interesting argument, this rare Judaean bronze not only represents a 
religious ceremony before the holiest temple of Rome, but accurately depicts a victimarius (sacrificial assistant) about to kill a pig.

While campaigning in the east, Caracalla made a pilgrimage to Carrhae in April AD 217. As the emperor stopped to urinate, he was murdered 
by the soldier Justin Martialis, who we are told was infuriated with Caracalla after he was passed up for the position of centurion. Macrinus, 
who accompanied the emperor and encouraged his murder, proclaimed himself emperor shortly thereafter.

This fascinating coin depicts Fulvia Plautilla, the wife of Caracalla, which is particularly surprising considering that she was exiled by her 
husband in AD 205 and killed in 211! Under Elagabalus, tetradrachm production became largely centralized either at the mint of Antioch or 
Emesa. The exception appears to be in Mesopotamia; the frontier province enjoyed a considerable amount of freedom in coin production, 
striking extremely rare Greek legend tetradrachms (Prieur 1724ff) and Latin legend aurei (Leu 42, lot 373) for the emperor. As Elagabalus 
claimed to be the illegitimate son of Caracalla and his cousin Julia Soaemias, many of these coins stress the continuity of the Severan line. For 
example, Prieur 1730 depicts a bust of Septimius Severus on the reverse and designates him the emperor&apos;s grandfather, another tetradrachm 
(CNG 103, lot 602) names Septimius Severus his grandfather and Caracalla his father, and the aforementioned Leu aureus describes Caracalla 
as PAT[ER]. So what to make of Plautilla on this coin? Although it does not explicitly name Plautilla &quot;mother,&quot; it fits nicely in the (pseudo?) 
Edessan dynastic series. It would seem to reflect a rumor that Elagabalus was the legitimate son of Caracalla and Plautilla, a rumor that is 
unrecorded in the historical sources. 

Bellinger thought the obverse depicted Severus Alexander, but the obverse legend would seem to preclude this. The presence of 
CЄ[OVHPROC] on the obverse was most likely intended to further underscore the continuity of the Severan line.

This coin is one of the great rarities of the Alexandrian series, with only one other specimen having been offered for sale (Marcel Jungfleisch 
Collection, Sotheby&apos;s, 1972, lot 26, which also was holed twice in antiquity). Another, heavily worn example resides in the collection of the 
American Numismatic Society in New York City (mistakenly attributed to regnal year 11). 

Nero issued a prodigious amount of billon tetradrachms at the Alexandria mint. It has been speculated that this was part of his fund-raising 
campaign to rebuild Rome after the devastating fire of AD 64 (he melted down the higher silver content tetradrachms already in circulation, 
and replaced them with the lower silver content billon tetradrachms). As a result, bronze coinage in general was neglected during Nero&apos;s reign 
in Alexandria, especially the larger denominations -hemidrachm and drachm.

Alexandria saw an immense output of coinage during the eighth year of Antoninus Pius&apos;s reign. The Zodiac drachms, mythological types, 
and a host of issues for the nomes appeared that year. One explanation for this activity centers on the celebration of the renewal of the Great 
Sothic cycle, the point when the star Sothis (Sirius) rises on the same point on the horizon as the sun. This cycle of 1461 years began early 
in the reign of Pius in AD 139, and apparently prompted a renewal in the ancient Egyptian religion, while the coin types also stressed the 
connections to the Greco-Roman Pantheon.

The Great Sothic Cycle was a calendrical cycle based on the heliacal rising in July of the star Sirius (known to the Greeks as Sothis) and lasting 
approximately 1460 years. According to ancient Egyptian mythology, in a Golden Age, the beginning of the flooding of the Nile coincided 
exactly with the rising of Sirius, which was reckoned as the New Year. Only once every 1460 years did Sirius rise at exactly the same time. 
Thus, the coincidence of this along with the concurrent beginning of the flooding of the Nile gave the event major cosmological significance 
by heralding not just the beginning of a new year, but the beginning of a new eon. This event also was thought to herald the appearance of the 
phoenix, a mythological bird which was reborn every 500 to 1000 years out of its own ashes. According to one version of the myth, each new 
phoenix embalmed its old ashes in an egg of myrrh, which it then deposited in the Egyptian city of Heliopolis. So important was the advent 
of the new Great Sothic Cycle, both to the realignment of the heavens and its signaling of the annual flooding of the Nile, that the Egyptians 
celebrated it in a five-day festival, which emphasized the important cosmological significance. 

In the third year of the reign of Antoninus Pius (AD 139/40), a new Great Sothic Cycle began. To mark this event, the mint of Alexandria 
struck an extensive series of coinage, especially in large bronze drachms, each related in some astrological way to the reordering of the 
heavens during the advent of the new Great Sothic Cycle. This celebration would continue throughout Pius&apos; reign, with an immense output of 
coinage during the eighth year of his reign in Egypt, which included this coin type, part of the Zodiac series.

In around 218 BC, shortly before the appearance of the silver denarius, mints in the Roman Republic began to strike silver coins bearing on 
the obverse a bust of Jupiter and on the reverse a figure of Victory placing a wreath upon a trophy. Known as a victoriatus in Latin or tropaikon 
in Greek, this coin was primarily issued to facilitate payments in Greek-speaking southern Italy, where its weight was roughly equivalent to 
a drachm or half nomos. Rome at this time had a great need for coinage, as the Second Punic War then raged across Italy, and the city needed 
silver to pay her allies. This function is demonstrated by the hoard evidence, which shows that their circulation was generally limited to 
southern Italy, and later Cisalpine Gaul and Spain. 

The victoriatus was generally struck in less pure silver than the denarius, rarely meeting the same 90% standard, yet it generally followed the 
same overall pattern of debasements. Despite this, it proved to be an important coin for the budding empire. Though the type was discontinued 
around 170 BC, the coins themselves continued to circulate, eventually becoming worn enough to function in the marketplace as quinarii. 
Accordingly, even into the early Imperial period, the silver quinarius was also sometimes refered to as a victoriatus.

This dramatic type was struck within fresh memory of the catastrophic Roman defeat at Arausio (Orange) in southern Gaul in 105 BC. Two 
Roman armies were wiped out trying to halt a mass migration of two Germanic tribes, the Cimbri and the Teutones. The disaster prompted 
the Roman populace to elect the experienced military man Gaius Marius as Consul for the second time. In a sharp break with tradition, they 
would re-elect him the next four years. The denarius of Q. Thermus, with a helmeted Mars replacing the usual head of Roma, reflects Roman 
society being put on war footing anticipating the German invasion. On the reverse, a Roman legionary, on the left, confronts a barbarian 
warrior wearing a horned helmet. Both adopt a fighting stance, shields to the fore, swords raised above their heads, points forward. The Roman 
protects a fallen comrade at his feet. Although the scene may depict a deed performed by the moneyer&apos;s ancestor, it also could be viewed as 
showing Marius, in the aftermath of Arausio, shielding Rome from the German menace.

The revolt of Rome&apos;s Italian allies (socii, hence &apos;Social War&apos;) broke out toward the close of the year 91 BC and was the culmination 
of longstanding grievances occasioned by the Senate&apos;s inept handling of foreign relations. The Marsi were especially prominent in this 
movement, hence the name &apos;Marsic Confederation,&apos; which is often applied to the rebel state. The main fighting was in the years 90-89 BC 
and the rebellion assumed alarming proportions when both consuls for 90 BC were defeated by rebel armies. Rome appeared to be in serious 
danger of defeat, but the movement collapsed as suddenly as it had begun. The victory was probably achieved largely through the political 
concession of granting Roman citizenship to the enemy. Thereafter, all of Italy south of the Po was united by this common bond. The coinage 
of the Marsic Confederation is of great interest, consisting principally of silver denarii, some of which bear the names of the rebel generals.

A subplot of the myth of the abduction of the Sabine women involved Tarpeia, a Vestal Virgin who betrayed Rome to the Sabines when they 
were attempting to rescue their captured wives and daughters. According to the historian Livy (1.11), the price for Tarpeia&apos;s betrayal was what 
the Sabine soldiers wore on their left arms. To Tarpeia, this meant the gold bracelets the men were wearing. The Sabines, however, offended 
by Tarpeia&apos;s reprehensible greed and treason, took her price literally and crushed her to death under the weight of their shields, which were 
also worn on their left arms. Tarpeia&apos;s corpse was then cast down from, or buried at the foot of, the cliff subsequently named for her -the 
Tarpeian Rock -from which notorious criminals were thrown to their deaths.

in Gaul and Spain, and this issue was produced to help finance his upcoming campaigns against Sertorius in Spain. The reverse type used on 
this coin was the first time the legionary eagle (aquila) and standards appeared as the main design element, and would influence a number of 
later issues, including those of Cn. Nerius and the famous legionary series of Mark Antony.

As consul for the year 88 BC, Sulla was awarded the coveted assignment of suppressing the revolt of Mithradates VI of Pontus, but political 
maneuvers resulted in this assignment being transferred to Marius. In response, Sulla turned his army on Rome, captured it, and reclaimed his 
command against Mithradates. His prosecution of the first Mithradatic War was successful, but he spared the Pontic king for personal gain. 
In 83 BC, Sulla returned to Italy as an outlaw, but he was able to win the support of many of the leading Romans. Within a year he fought his 
way to Rome, where he was elected dictator. It was during this campaign to Rome that this denarius was struck. The obverse type represents 
Sulla&apos;s claim to be acting in Rome&apos;s best interest. The reverse shows Sulla enjoying the highest honor to which a Roman could aspire-the 
celebration of a triumph at Rome.

The togate figure in the chariot on the reverse is identified as a IVDEX; this is usually translated as &quot;judge,&quot; but a more correct definition might 
be &quot;arbiter.&quot; Efforts to identify the figure have run into the problem that there was no formal independent office of Iudex and any important 
magistrate could be called by that title. Michael Harlan proposes that the figure could represent the moneyer himself, who may be the same 
Titus Vettius who served as Quaestor in Sicily circa 73 BC; the grain ear to the right of the chariot in this case would refer to Sicily, the main 
supplier of wheat to Rome.

Though a puteal is often described as a &quot;well head,&quot; the Puteal Scribonianum depicted here was a walled enclosure erected around the spot of 
a lightning strike in the Roman Forum. The Romans believed such spots were marked by the gods, and hence worthy of veneration. Erected 
circa 204 BC by a member of the Libo clan, the Puteal became a popular meeting spot for money lenders and merchants.

Five Muses 

The reverses of this series -Hercules playing the lyre and the Muses, can be none other than the celebrated statue group by an unknown 
Greek artist, taken from Ambracia and placed in the Aedes Herculis Musarum, which was erected by M. Fulvius Nobilior in 187 BC after 
the capture of Ambracia in 189 BC (Plin. NH xxxv.66; Ov. Fast. vi.812). By the second century BC, Rome had overrun most of Greece and 
was captivated by Hellenic art and culture, not the least of which was its sculpture. Fulvius is said to have taken the statues to Rome because 
he learned in Greece that Hercules was a musagetes (leader of the Muses). Remains of this temple have been found in the area of the Circus 
Flaminius close to the southwest part of the circus itself, and northwest of the porticus Octaviae. An inscription found nearby, &apos;M. Fulvius 
M. f. Ser. n. Nobilior cos. Ambracia cepit;&apos; may have been on the pedestal of one of the statues. The official name of the temple was Herculis 
Musarum aedes, which Servius and Plutarch called Herculis et Musarum aedes.

This type is called &quot;Terpsichore&quot; by Crawford and most other authors, but Phil Davis has recently identified this coin type as Erato. A complete 
discussion of this subject can be found in the article Phil wrote for the Festschrift created for the late Rick Witschonke (FIDES, pp. 393-401). 
Phil&apos;s logic is very sound and will make completing a set of Muses much easier as the previously rare, known from a single die, Erato is now 
shown to be just a die variety. (Davis identifies the obverse turtle symbol as being for Terpsichore.)

Describing Mt. Eryx and its temple complex, the Greek historian Polybius of Megalopolis writes: On its summit, which is flat, stands the 
temple of Venus Erycina, which is indisputably the first in wealth and general magnificence of all the Sicilian holy places. The city extends 
along the hill under the actual summit, the ascent to it being very long and steep on all sides. World History, 1.55

This early coin of Marcus Junius Brutus, struck during his term as moneyer in 54 BC, refers to his illustrious ancestry, which included L. 
Junius Brutus, one of the legendary first consuls of the nascent Roman Republic, and C. Servilius Ahala, who slew the prospective tyrant 
Spurius Maelius. Celebrating his connection to the tyrannicide Ahala proved eerily prophetic 10 years later, when, because of his name and 
reputation for integrity, Brutus was recruited by conspirators against Julius Caesar and became the figurehead leader of the assassins.

The portrait on the obverse has sometimes been identified as the famous chief of the Arverni, Vercingetorix, whom Julius Caesar captured 
in 52 BC in Alesia. It is difficult to imagine anyone placing such a dramatic portrait of a defeated foe on their coinage, but it is clear from 
surviving sources of the period that the Romans had a good deal of respect for the Gauls as honorable warriors. Crawford and Sear believe this 
identification is unlikely, but the large, distinctive, and carefully engraved head suggests the die cutter worked with an eye toward creating an 
individualized portrait, rather than a stylized personification of a Gaul. The reverse is also of particular historical interest, in that it depicts the 
manner in which chariots were used in Celtic Gaul, and perhaps in Britain as well.

This evocative type demonstrates that Roman moneyers were quite familiar with the legends and coin types of obscure Greek cities. The city 
of Gergis in Troas, near the site of ancient Troy, was said to be the birthplace of the Sibyl Herophile, a priestess with prophetic powers. Coins 
of the city struck circa 350-300 BC depict a head of the Sibyl on the obverse and a seated sphinx, symbol of prophecy, on the reverse. The 
types are repeated here, surely intended as a nod to the Trojan origins of Julius Caesar&apos;s gens.

The curious scene depicted on the reverse of this type refers to a foundation myth for the city of Lanuvium, parent city of Rome. According 
to a legend related by Dionysius of Halicaranassus in Roman Antiquities, the hero Aeneas saw a fire burning in a nearby forest and went to 
investigate. As he drew closer he saw the fire was being fed by a she-wolf, who was dropping sticks into the blaze, while an eagle standing 
nearby fanned it with his wings. A fox kept intruding, trying to snuff out the fire by wetting his tail in a nearby stream and beating the flames 
down with it, but was driven off by the eagle and wolf. The fox was interpreted as Carthage, trying to snuff out Rome before its flame could 
burn brightly, while the eagle and she-wolf are symbols of the Roman army and people respectively.

From the R. Baker Collection. 

This rare half-denarius was issued contemporaneously with L. Aemilius Buca&apos;s Julius Caesar portrait coinage, and his &quot;Sulla&apos;s dream&quot; 
denarius of the same period. Buca may have been descended from a relative of Sulla&apos;s and thus identified with Caesar&apos;s career arc of restoring 
order to a state riven by civil war. Pax, goddess of peace, is here portrayed for the first time on Roman coinage. This and the clasped hands on 
the reverse both allude to the peace and harmony restored to the state by Caesar&apos;s recent victories over his enemies.

The shrine of Venus Cloacina (&quot;Venus of the Sewer&quot;) was a circular platform above the entrance to the Cloaca Maxima, Rome&apos;s oldest and 
largest sewer, on the north side of the Roman Forum. This denarius by the moneyer L. Mussidius Longus provides the best record of its 
original form. The platform was encircled by a trellis and supported statues of two goddesses; possibly one portrayed Venus and the other 
Cloacina, the original Etruscan goddess of the small stream that later became the Cloaca Maxima. Cloacina was later amalgamated with Venus 
for unknown reasons and became an &quot;aspect&quot; of the goddess.

This intriguing denarius refers to the cult of Diana Nemorensis, an aspect of the virgin huntress worshipped at the town of Aricia, located in 
the Alban Hills near Lake Nemi. Likely the hometown of the moneyer, the town was situated near an archaic shrine containing a triple statue 
of the goddess as depicted on the reverse. Aricia was also the birthplace of Atia, mother of Octavian, and the types are likely intended to honor 
her (and Octavian&apos;s) origins.

C. Domitius Calvinus was appointed governor of Spain by Octavian after that province was ceded by Sextus Pompey, son of Pompey the 
Great. The province was in a state of chaos after years of civil war and the rule by Sextus, who governed as little more than a brigand. The 
stern Calvinus, formerly magister equitum under Caesar, pacified the province, putting down a revolt by the Ceretani, although not before 
subjecting a legionary detachment to the ancient punishment of decimation (executing one out of ten men) for cowardice in the face of the 
enemy. The minting of these denarii, probably at Osca itself, marks the restoration of Roman order in Spain and the renewed flow of Spanish 
silver to the Roman treasury.

P. Sepullius Macer was the most prolific moneyer of 44 BC, striking the widest variety of Caesar portrait issues. Caesar is shown wreathed, 
sometimes also veiled, and his titles given as CAESAR IMP and CAESAR DICT PERPETVO. The reverse image of Venus includes a number 
of minor design variants. The varying quality of portraiture and strike likewise indicate great haste of manufacture, perhaps in preparation for 
Caesar&apos;s projected Parthian war.

Gaius Cossutius Maridianus was apparently the last man appointed to the recently expanded quattrovirate of moneyers in 44 BC. His portrait 
coinage for Julius Caesar commences later than that of his colleagues, starting after Caesar was named Dictator In Perpetuo (&quot;Perpetual 
Dictator&quot;) on February 15; uniquely, the obverse legend for this type reads DICT IN PERPETVO, including the IN. All of his Caesar heads 
are veiled, alluding to Caesar&apos;s role as Pontifex Maximus. 

946. 
The Caesarians. Julius Caesar. 41 BC. AR Denarius (19mm, 3.77 g, 8h). Rome mint; L. Flaminius Chilo, moneyer.

While this coin derives its general type from those issues struck at Rome in the month prior to Caesar&apos;s assassination in March 44 BC, 
its anepigraphic obverse now shows a head of Caesar that is no longer veiled, while on the reverse, Venus Genetrix holds a caduceus in 
place of the traditional Victory. The idealized portrait of Julius Caesar, with its definite impression of divinity, is not an individual die-
engraver&apos;s attempt at artistic fancy, but must have been influenced by Octavian&apos;s consciously conceived program of manipulating public 
images (including that of Caesar) at Rome. 

On 1 January 42 BC, the Senate recognized Caesar&apos;s new divine status as the Divus Julius and constructed a temple on the site of his cremation 
in the Forum. The Venus Genetrix on the reverse shows a similar manipulation. Deriving from the Greek Aphrodite Ourania, or heavenly 
Aphrodite, Venus Genetrix became not only the divine patroness of Rome through her son Aeneas, but also the ancestor of the gens Julia, 
through Aeneas&apos; son, Ascanius (Iulus). On the night before Pharsalus in 48 BC, Caesar vowed to construct a temple in her honor in Rome if he 
was successful against Pompey. Once completed, this temple, which housed a statue of the goddess, then became the centerpiece of his new 
forum. There are marked differences, however, between the statue (evidenced by several extant copies) and her depiction on the denarii struck 
in the month before his assassination. While the statue emphasized her procreative powers, the coins show her in a more martial and political 
context: holding a Victory in her right hand and a scepter in her left, either surrounded by weaponry (sometime set on a globe), or with the 
scepter set on a star (a sign of divinity). While these attributes may shift from one to another, they emphasize not only the divine assistance 
in Caesar&apos;s military and political victories, but also allude tentatively to his semi-divinity. The Venus of this coin, however, minimizes her 
connection to earlier associations; instead, she now presents an image of Felicitas (Good Fortune), by replacing the Victory with a caduceus. 
It is not the Venus Genetrix of Julius Caesar, then, but now Venus Felix of all Rome who is at work. Thus, through the assistance of the two 
transformed divine agencies -the impending one of the Divus Julius, and that of Venus -Octavian was able to take his first few steps toward 
political ascendancy.

After finalizing the arrangements of the second triumvirate, Mark Antony proceeded to Asia, first establishing a residence at Ephesus. Once 
there, he issued a series of coins commemorating the second triumvirate and the consulship of his brother, Lucius Antony, in 41 BC. M. 
Cocceius Nerva, a lieutenant of Mark Antony, was responsible for issuing the latter series. In his capacity as consul, Lucius took an overt 
stance against the unpopular Octavian, which eventually led to military hostilities between the two. Octavian, with the help of Agrippa and 
Salvidienus, besieged Lucius in Perusia (the &quot;Perusine War&quot;). Lucius eventually surrendered, and he was subsequently sent as a promagistrate 
to Spain, where he apparently (and conveniently) died shortly thereafter.

This was the first cistophorus minted in Asia in more than a decade and marked the beginning of a huge output of cistophori during the 
subsequent decade. Here, for the first time, Octavian is depicted as laureate, referring to Apollo and symbolizing his divinity. The obverse 
legend means &quot;Champion of the Liberty of the Roman People.&quot; The figure of Pax on the reverse tells of the peace that will surely result from 
Octavian&apos;s triumph over Rome&apos;s enemies. 

The significance of Apollo is emphasized by two changes in design from previous cistophori. The cista mystica, or snake basket, a common 
symbol in the cult of Dionysus that was prominently featured on the obverse of previous cistophori, is drastically reduced in size, and thus less 
significant. Similarly, the reverse is no longer encircled by the Dionysiac garland of ivy, but by Apollo&apos;s laurel wreath.

The idealized head on the reverse has been variously identified as a deified and rejuvenated Julius Caesar, Augustus himself, or a male 
personification of the dawning Golden Age. The presence of a comet above the head, likely intended as the &quot;Julian star&quot; that appeared shortly 
after Caesar&apos;s death, argues for the former identification.

Claudia Julia Livia, nicknamed Livilla (&quot;Little Livia&quot;), was the daughter of Nero Claudius Drusus and Antonia Minor, and sister to Germanicus 
and the future emperor Claudius. Though Roman historians describe her as remarkably beautiful and charming, they also condemn her as 
a power-hungry adulteress and murderess. Tacitus accuses her of conspiring with her lover, the Praetorian Prefect Sejanus, to poison her 
husband, the imperial heir Drusus Caesar, who died in AD 23. This coin, struck in the name of Drusus shortly before his death, depicts on the 
obverse a veiled and classically beautiful woman as Pietas, goddess of religious piety and dutifulness. David Vagi has argued convincingly 
that the head represents Livilla, given that the other bronze coins issued the same year depict Drusus himself and the couple&apos;s twin sons, 
forming a &quot;family set.&quot;

Having inherited the imperial throne with virtually no experience of government or the military, Gaius Germanicus Caesar, nicknamed 
Caligula (&quot;bootikins&quot;), had no achievements to tout on his coinage. He thus fell back on advertising his blue-blooded lineage. Through his 
mother, Agrippina Sr., Gaius was descended from Augustus, and also Agrippa, the victor of Actium. His father was the Roman paragon 
Germanicus, son of Nero Claudius Drusus and nephew of Tiberius. Through his mother Antonia, Germanicus was the grandson of Mark 
Antony and Octavia, the sister of Augustus. Accordingly, many of Caligula&apos;s coins recall his dynastic connections to both the Julians and the 
Claudians. This denarius type pairs his obverse portrait with a reverse effigy of the deified Augustus, who is shown wearing the radiate crown 
of godhead. Unfortunately, aristocratic genes did not translate into success as a ruler, as Rome would soon find out.

Upon Caligula&apos;s assassination in January, AD 41, Claudius was the sole surviving Julio-Claudian male. When members of the Praetorian 
Guard found him cowering behind a curtain in the palace, they immediately acclaimed him as Emperor and brought him to the Castra Praetoria, 
their fortified camp on the outskirts of Rome. Claudius astutely awarded the Praetorians a substantial bonus, and, with 10,000 heavily armed 
soldiers backing him, he easily forced the Senate to accept him as the next princeps. On this aureus, Claudius clearly acknowledges his debt 
to the Praetorians, depicting the walled Castra the legend IMPER RECEPT --&quot;The Emperor Received.&quot;

Beginning during the latter imperatorial period during the campaigns of Julius Caesar, Roman interest and influence in Britan grew throughout 
the next three centuries. Many emperors were personally involved in campaigns, which were often commemorated on their respective coinages. 

During the reign of Claudius, Verica, king of the Atrebates and ally of Rome, was forced into exile by invasions of the Catuvellauni, a 
neighboring tribe to the east. This served as the pretense for Claudius&apos; invasion of Britan in AD 43, led by the general Aulus Plautius, who 
subsequently served as governor of the region (the future emperor Vespasian also ranked among the commanders). While Claudius had some 
participation in the campaigns -bringing reinforcements and elephants to Camulodunum -and received a triumph after his return to Rome, 
he refused the title Britannicus. The success of these invasions was commemorated on various issues. One, an issue of aurei, depicts the two 
triumphal arches erected by the Roman Senate -one in Gaul and the other in Rome -in honor of these momentous victories. So momentous 
was the successful establishment of Roman rule in Britain that Claudius celebrated it even on a provincial issue from the far eastern mint in 
Cappadocia.

While Julius Caesar recognized the value of expanding Rome&apos;s port facilities at Ostia, it was Claudius who actually began building in AD 
42. As part of the construction, one of Caligula&apos;s pleasure galleys was scuttled and filled with cement; above it was constructed a lighthouse 
surmounted by a statue of Neptune. Although the actual date of completion is not certain, it must have occurred shortly before this sestertius 
was minted. A further expansion of the facilities was required under Trajan and Hadrian. By the fourth century, however, the port&apos;s importance 
began to diminish as a result of silting. Soon the region became a breeding ground for malaria and was abandoned.

This monumental triumphal arch was erected by Nero to commemorate Roman military campaigns against the Parthians in Mesopotamia and 
Armenia. Although not particularly successful in a military sense, with Paetus losing almost his entire army at Randeia in Armenia, the war did 
end with a peace treaty favorable to Rome that was upheld for nearly fifty years. This coin type is vitally important for architectural historians 
as the arch&apos;s appearance is only known through its depiction on the coins.

This reverse type commemorates the protection of Nero from the Pisonian Conspiracy. Events of the years AD 64-65 defined the subsequent 
reputation of Nero as a cruel and self-indulgent ruler. His &quot;excesses&quot; resulted in a conspiracy to overthrow and replace him with Gaius 
Calpurnius Piso. Among the conspirators were many high-ranking members of Nero&apos;s court including Seneca the Younger, the poet Lucan, 
and Petronius, who called himself Nero&apos;s &quot;arbiter of elegance.&quot; To Nero, the failure of a conspiracy made up of those so close to him could 
have been achieved only through divine intervention. As the king of the Gods oversaw the security of the Roman state, Nero believed it was 
Jupiter the Guardian (Custos) who had saved him from harm.

Though reigning scarcely seven months, Servius Sulpicius Galba has the honor of inspiring Rome&apos;s portrait artists to reach heights never 
again equaled or surpassed. Achieving the throne at age 70, Galba was a wizened Roman aristocrat whose sagging, craggy countenance could 
not have been more different than that of his predecessor, the bloated and dissolute Nero. Indeed, Galba seems to have deliberately promoted 
himself as a steely martinet who would restore Rome to proper Republican austerity. His coinage pairs his aged, scowling portrait with 
reverses touting traditional Roman virtues, here depicting Libertas, a concept that embodies both freedom and responsibility. Rome&apos;s mint 
masters rose brilliantly to the challenge, producing astoundingly lifelike and sculptural portraits such as the present example. But Galba&apos;s 
austerity program proved to be a major miscalculation, as Rome was not yet ready for such bitter medicine.

The Victory celebrated on the reverse of this type can only be the critical Civil War battle of Cremona (or Bedriacum) over the rival pretender 
Otho. Suetonius notes with distaste the unsavory delight Vitellius took in the slaughter of his countrymen: &quot;When he reached the plains on 
which the battles were fought, some of those around him being offended at the smell of the carcasses which lay rotting upon the ground, he 
had the audacity to encourage them by a most detestable remark, &quot;That a dead enemy smelt not amiss, especially if he were a fellow citizen.&quot;&quot;

The Flavian and Julio Claudian coinages include an enigmatic series of large bronzes with Latin legends and a distinctive broad fabric that 
were clearly not produced at at the regular mints of Rome and Lugdunum. Carradice and Buttrey, in RIC II, describe this mint as producing 
coins with &quot;large portraits with heavy, muscular necks, large reverse figures and lettering that tends to be crowded and heavily seriffed.&quot; 
Various experts have placed this mint in Gaul, Bithynia, or Thrace; David R. Sear argues for a short-lived officina in Rome.

Circa AD 103, the Senate awarded Trajan the title Optimus Princeps, &quot;Best of Emperors,&quot; reflecting the immense prestige and widespread 
popularity he had gained through victory in the Dacian Wars and the constitutional nature of his rule. He proudly placed the title on his coinage 
and inscriptions, including this aureus of AD 107. Hadrian briefly used the title on his coins struck in AD 117 (perhaps by accident), and it 
appeared on a single issue of Antoninus Pius circa AD 145, but after that it was not employed by a living emperor until the reign of Constantine 
I the Great, whose numismatic imagery was closely modeled on that of Trajan.

Trajan&apos;s sister Marciana and her daughter Matidia moved into the Imperial palace upon his ascension and formed part of a distaff cabal of 
women relations, led by his wife Plotina, who are widely thought to have influenced the domestic policies of his government. Upon her death 
on 29 August AD 112, Marciana was formally deified and honored with this attractive denarius issue, depicting an eagle bearing a scepter to 
the heavens. 

1071. 
Matidia. Augusta, AD 112-119. AV Aureus (19mm, 7.20 g, 6h). Rome mint. Struck under Trajan, AD 112-117.

Matidia, the niece of Trajan, proved to be the lynchpin that held together the imperial succession for the next three generations. Matidia was 
married three times in succession to important Roman Senators, all of whom predeceased her. Vibia Sabina, her daughter by her first husband, 
was married to the future emperor Hadrian. By her third husband, she bore Rupilia Faustina, who went on to become mother to Faustina 
the Elder, future wife of Antoninus Pius; she was also the grandmother of Marcus Aurelius and also his wife Faustina the Younger, and thus 
great-grandmother (on both sides) to Commodus. This aureus was struck to mark Matidia&apos;s elevation to Augusta, which she attained after her 
mother&apos;s death. Matidia died herself in AD 119; her son-in-law Hadrian delivered the funeral oration and arranged for her deification.

One of Pius&apos; first actions as emperor was to send Q. Lollius Urbicus, a previous governor of Germania Inferior, to Britain to quell a number 
of revolts. While most of the sources note the Brigantes (located in Northumbria) as the primary focus of these events, circa AD 143-144, 
most of his campaigning was against the lowland tribes of Scotland, the Votadini, Selgovae, Damnonii, and Novantae. His campaigns were 
successfully completed by 144, after which Urbicus and the Legio II Augusta built the Antonine Wall. This issue of sestertii was struck in 
commemoration of these events, for which Pius was likely acclaimed imperator for the second time.

($30,000) 

Ex Triton III (1 December 1999), lot 1106. 

The scene on the reverse was previously used as a medallic type under Antoninus Pius (Gnecchi pl. 50, 6). A circa 2nd century AD bronze 
phalera discovered in 1732 on the Palatine Hill (LIMC [Tellus], no. 39 = Tocci pl. LXVIII, D) also features a near identical scene, but includes 
the inscription &quot;INVENTORI LVCIS SOLI INVICTO AVGVSTO&quot; in two lines (this is among the earliest known references to Sol Invictus). 
The association between the &quot;invincible&quot; sun and the emperor would frequently be stressed throughout the 3rd century AD, but this medallion 
and the above mentioned pieces demonstrate that such an assimilation was being explored during the 2nd century AD. Here we see the sun god 
beginning his daily journey, ascending into the heavens with the guidance of Lucifer, son of Eos (dawn). It stresses Sol&apos;s role in the cycle of 
life, death, and rebirth, and the dependence of earth on the sun&apos;s life-giving powers. Naturally, an emperor would desire to be associated with a 
deity who was so essential to the functioning of the universe. As medallions such as this were often presented during New Year&apos;s celebrations, 
it was perhaps intended to underscore the welfare that the emperor would bring to the earth in the coming year (Toynbee p. 93). 

Lucifer (&quot;light-bringer&quot;), the equivalent of the Greek Phosphoros, was the personification of the planet Venus as the morning star. In the book 
of Isaiah (14:12), the prophet refers to the King of Babylon as a &quot;shining one, son of the morning,&quot; who has fallen from heaven (an obvious 
parallel to Satan&apos;s fall from heaven). The Hebrew word for &quot;shining one&quot; (helel) was translated into Latin as Lucifer, and the name has since 
become synonymous with the Devil.

This sestertius celebrates the Severan campaign in Britain circa AD 208-211, the last Roman attempt to conquer Scotland thereby controlling 
the entire island. Septimius Severus mounted the expedition in mid AD 208, hoping for a quick victory to crown his later years, and also 
to curb the ferocious sibling hatred of his sons, Caracalla and Geta, who accompanied him. Caracalla took the opportunity to play common 
soldier and ingratiate himself with the legions, while Geta took an administrative role in York. But what was supposed to be an easy conquest 
turned into a long, bitter slog, which took its toll on the emperor&apos;s health and intensified the brothers&apos; mutual hatred. Severus died at York on 
4 February AD 211. Caracalla and Geta quickly abandoned Scotland, declared victory, and returned to Rome.

This artistic aerial view depicts the Circus as it would be seen from the Palatine Hill. According to Pliny, the Circus was established during 
the reign of the Tarquinius Priscus, Etruscan king of Rome (circa 616-579 BC), although a permanent structure may not have existed until 
329 BC, when the starting gates (carceres) were erected. By the early 2nd century AD, the structure was very close to the form that we see on 
our coin. In the center of the Circus we find the spina (&quot;spine&quot;), upon which is the obelisk of the Pharaoh Ramesses the Great that Augustus 
brought to Rome and erected in the Circus (it is located today in Rome&apos;s Piazza del Popolo). At each end of the spina is a meta, or conical 
column situated where the charioteers would make their harrowing turns, while an equestrian statue of Trajan and a shrine of Cybele can be 
found immediately to the left and right of the obelisk, respectively. 

In the foreground and to right are arcades and a prominent arched gate, while on the left we find the semicircular end of the structure, with the 
attic statuary of a triumphal arch of Titus visible. The temple of Sol and Luna, built into the seating, is visible on the far end of the structure, 
to the left of the obelisk&apos;s peak.

The reassignment of this peculiar issue to the end of the reign of Gallienus as opposed to the traditional placement during the interregnum 
between the death of Aurelian and the elevation of Tacitus has been convincingly argued by David Yonge. He bases his determination on flan 
manufacture, portrait style, and a comparative analysis of mid-third century Roman monetary denominations, and suggests that this issue was 
probably a commemorative issue in anticipation of Gallienus&apos; entry into Rome after his victories over the Herulians and Goths at Naissus.

A member of the foederati (allied Germanic tribes who served in the Roman army in return for land), Odovacar was appointed their leader in 
Italy in AD 475 by the magister militia Orestes, who promised in return a third of the Italian peninsula if Odovacar and his Germans would 
assist Orestes&apos; revolt against the western emperor, Julius Nepos. Following the defeat of Nepos, Orestes elevated his son, Romulus, to the 
rank of Augustus, and immediately set about revoking his earlier arrangement with the foederati. In return, Odovacar revolted against Orestes, 
who was defeated, captured, and executed. Odovacar was subsequently proclaimed rex Italiae and, on 4 September AD 476, he compelled the 
young Romulus to abdicate, sending the imperial insignia to Constantinople and thus ending Roman Imperial rule in the West.

Extremely Rare Umayyad Caliphate Solidus 

1226. 
ISLAMIC, Umayyad Caliphate. temp. Mu&apos;awiya I ibn Abi Sufyan. AH 41-60 / AD 661-680. AV Solidus (22mm, 
4.33 g, 6h). Pseudo-Byzantine type. crowned and draped busts of Heraclius and Heraclius Constantine facing; crossbars on 
crowns removed / uiCTOriÅ ÅugЧ 5oe, cross potent, with upper portion of vertical bar removed to form a large I, set on three 
steps; CONOß. AGC I 3 var. = Miles, Earliest 3 and pl. XLV, 6 (Bedoukian Collection) var. (officina letter); Walker, Arab-
Byzantine -; Album 3548; ICV 121. Good VF, traces of underlying luster. 
($30,000) 

The earliest, and still best, discussion of the early pre-reform Islamic gold coinage is that of Miles. There, he records four, based on 
contemporary Byzantine prototypes: one featuring the emperor Phocas: a second with Heraclius and his son Heraclius Constantine; a third 
of the later Heraclius and Heraclius Constantine type; and, lastly, the issue with Heraclius flanked by his sons, Heraclius Constantine and 
Heraclonas. Our coin is an example of that last type. On the reverse, the cross potent has been altered in order to &quot;dechristianize&quot; the cross, 
in keeping with the Islamic prohibition against graven images. To date, our coin is the only example of this type known with this officina. 
Examples, however, of this type, but with the additional letters IA and IB ares known (see One hundred coins of the great dynasties of Islam 
[privately printed]), as well as one with an addition letter I and the Heraclian monogram (NGSA VIII, lot 226). When taken together with 
Miles&apos; other types, which have similar numbers on the reverse (see Album 23, lot 68 and Morton &amp; Eden 63, lot 7), the multiple letters -I, IA, 
IB (and, possibly, an IΓ) -supports the suggestion that these numbers may represent the caliphal year of Mu&apos;awiya, during whose reign these 
coins were struck. Since the Byzantine prototypes were already circulating widely within the former eastern territories of the Byzantines now 
held by the Umayyads, it naturally followed that the Muslims would strike similar types, but with certain specific modifications -namely, the 
appearance of the Christian Cross. According to the Maronite Chronicle (AG 970 (AD 660]), however, this coinage was not accepted by the 
presumably Christian members of the population, &quot;because there was no cross on it.&quot; 

On at least two occasions, however, Mu&apos;awiya was required to pay tribute to the Byzantines, and it is possible that these coins were struck 
specifically for that purpose. One was in AD 659, when the payment supposedly amounted to a thousand nomismata. The second was in 
AD 678, when Mu&apos;awiya was forced to agree to a very harsh treaty that obliged him to make an annual payment to the Byzantine emperor 
of three thousand nomismata. Since these coins would have gone to Constantinople to fulfill the required payment, and there subsequently 
melted down to be restruck later (in addition to the reported rejection of these coins among the Christian members of the local population), the 
extreme rarity of these coins today can be accounted for easily. This conclusion may be supported by their iconography. The originals of all 
four types cited by Miles would have circulated widely in Syria, which depended on Byzantine gold and copper coinage -both in great supply 
-to support their monetary needs for both large transactions and everyday purchases. The originals of the first three types were undoubtedly 
well known to the inhabitants of Syria and, with only minor alterations in their design, Mu&apos;awiya could expect them to be accepted in 
circulation without difficulty. In its original form, however, the fourth type, with its Christian and imperial iconography, would have been 
familiar to the general public as a direct and potent symbol of Byzantine power. By removing the specifically Christian iconography from 
the design, the three imperial figures could appear as tribute bearers bringing their gifts, such as the three wise men, who were well known to 
both Christians and Muslims. 

This extremely rare piece may be regarded as one of the earliest Islamic gold issues.

Iconic Rarity of the Umayyad Caliphate 

1227. 
ISLAMIC, Umayyad Caliphate. temp. &apos;Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan. AH 65-86 / AD 685-705. AV Dinar (20mm, 
4.23 g, 6h). Unnamed (Dimashq [Damascus]?) mint. Dated AH 77 (AD 696/7). First portion of the kalimat at-tawḥīd: lā ilāha 
illā-llāhu waḥdahu lā sharīka lahu (there is no god except Allah, and one [is] he; (there is) no partner to him) in three lines; 
in outer margin, the &quot;Umayyad Second Symbol&quot; (Sura 9 [al-tauba]:33): muḥammadur rasūlu-llāh arsalahu bi-&apos;lhudā wa dīn 
al-haqq lī-yuzhirahu &apos;ala al-dīn kollihi walau kariha al-mushrikūn ( • Muhammad is the messenger of Allah; him He sent with 
guidance and true faith to make it prevail over all other faiths even though the polytheists may hate it) / Sura 112 (al-ikhlas) 
Āllah ahad Āllah āl-samad lam yalīd wa lam yalūd (Allah [is] One; Allah [is] the Eternal, the Absolute; not begetting and not 
begotten) in three lines; in outer margin, b-ismi-llāh zarb hazā l-dinār fī sanat seb&apos; wa seb&apos;īn (in the name of Allah struck this 
dinar in the year seven and seventy (after the Hijra)). AGC I 41; SICA 2, 1 var. (no pellet); Walker, Arab-Byzantine, pp. lvi 
and 84; Album 125; ICV 155; Roma XIV, lot 894 (same dies). Near EF, attractive surfaces with underlying luster. Extremely 
rare with addition of pellet in obverse marginal legend and ālef in the reverse, and the key date in the series. ($150,000) 

This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a superb example of the Umayyad dinar struck in the year 77 of the Hijra. This iconic coin was 
the first of its kind to describe the tenets of the Islamic Faith rather than being issued on behalf of a political dynasty. It exercised an influence 
far beyond the borders of the Islamic Empire for over a thousand years. It drew a clear line between the coinage of the former rulers of the 
Levant, who were the Trinitarian Byzantines, and the monophysite Arabs. Its texts perfectly encapsulated the new Faith of Islam. The obverse 
field states the unique nature of God, and in the margin that Muhammad, as the messenger of God, was responsible for the spread of this belief. 
The field legend on the reverse expands on this by ruling out the incarnation of Christ as the Son of God. The margin emphasizes that the 
coin was struck in the name of God, rather than the Umayyad ruler, and shows the date of its striking in the new Hijra era. Thus, the legends 
encapsulated a vigorous response to the Byzantine gold solidus of Justinian II where an image of Christ was placed on the obverse and that 
of the Emperor grasping a cross on the reverse. 

History does not record the exact date at which the Caliph &apos;Abd al-Malik bin Marwan introduced his new coinage, but because of the rarity of 
this issue the cataloger suggests that it was probably toward the end of the year 77, perhaps for the pilgrimage season at the time of the &apos;Eid 
al-Adha. All those who held examples of this coin in their hands, and the annual issues which followed after it, carried with them a powerful 
missionary document, which explained all that was necessary for a follower of the Faith to accept. In an age before modern communications, 
coinage was the most effective messenger that the government possessed to sway the hearts and minds of the people under its rule.

Ex Numismatica Genevensis SA VIII (24 November 2014), lot 238. 

Beginning with the Rashidun (AH 31-41 [AD 632-661]), the Muslims began to expand their conquests into modern-day Afghanistan and 
Pakistan. Comprising the kingdoms of Kapisa-Gandhara, Zabulistan, and Sindh, this territory, which since ancient times had culturally and 
politically been a part of India, was considered by the Muslims as the frontier of al-Hind (as India was known to them). Because these early 
invasions proved to be difficult, the caliph &apos;Uthman ibn Affan (AH 23-35 [AD 644-656]) forbade any further expansion into India. From 
this point until well into the Umayyad Caliphate, the prolonged struggle between the rulers of Kabul and Zabul with the Muslim governors 
of Sistan, Khurasan and Makran resulted in a strategy by the Arabs to exact tribute from these rulers, rather than by conquest, thus stalling 
Muslim expansion into these areas. 

The Umayyads, under their caliph Mu&apos;awiya I ibn Abi Sufyan, once again attempted to expand into India. Launching several campaigns over 
the next three decades, these frontier provinces remained as impenetrable as they had for the Rashidun, and once again, the Arabs relied on 
tribute. The pirate activity from ports in Sindh against Muslim shipping, however, provided an opportunity. The Viceroy of the East, al-Hajjaj 
bin Yusuf, ordered his son-in-law, Muhammad bin al-Qasim al-Thaqafi, to deal with the pirates. Mounting an expedition by land and sea, the 
Umayyad general conquered the port of al-Daybul in AH 92 (AD 711/2). Exercising clemency to the local Hindus, Muhammad bin al-Qasim 
was able to make the city a bridghead of Muslim expansion inward, and it was in this city that the Umayyads began to mint the first dirhams 
on the Indian subcontinent three years later. 

From al-Daybul until his death in AH 97 (AD 715), Muhammad bin al-Qasim and his army advanced along the Indus River, eventually 
conquering all of Sindh. In AH 93/4 (AD 712), he took the city of Multan from Chach of Alor after a two-month siege. Although, an adept 
general at the age of 20, Muhammad bin al-Qasim wa ill-fated by his association with al-Hajjaj and the caliph, al-Walid I.A wealthy city, 
Multan probably became the Umayyad governor&apos;s seat and it was probably here that this dirham was struck (similar to the Ummayad al-
Andalus mint issues being actually struck at Qurduba [Cordoba]). Owing to is fine style, the dies for this issue were probably imported from 
outside in preparation for the first issue of tribute to be sent back to Dimashq or Wasit.

Qaramita was the popular nickname of a group of Isma&apos;ili Shīas. After challenging unsuccessfully the &apos;Abbasids, the Qaramita established an 
Isma&apos;ili republic in eastern Arabia. From there, they raided western Arabia and Iraq, stealing the Black Stone of the Kaaba during a raid on 
Mecca. In AD 909, al-Mahdi, the Qaramita candidate for caliph, with the help of the Berbers, established the Fatimid dynasty.

Previously unpublished until the appearance of the Numismatica Genevensis SA coin, this exceedingly rare 10 dirhams represents an important 
period in Mongol history. Following the Mongol conquest of eastern Afghanistan in AH 618, the inhabitants of the district of Kurraman, 
a river area in what are today the tribal borderlands between Afghanistan and Pakistan, showed their allegiance by striking coinage in the 
name of the Great Khan. Following the death of Ögedei Khan in AH 639 (AD 1241), a period of turmoil followed during the succession. His 
wife, Töregene (Turakina) became regent, serving until her son Güyük was elected Great Khan in AH 644 (AD 1246). During this regency, 
Töregene ruled with complete authority as Great Khatun -female counterpart to the Great Khan. 

On this coin, however, neither Töregene&apos;s namen or title appears. Instead, the Abbasid caliph al-Musta&apos;sim is cited as al-&apos;amīr al-mūminīn -
the center of relious and spiritual authority during this uncertain period among the Mongols. The extreme rarity of these coins belies their use. 
If minted as tribute to the Caliph in Baghdad, or used as payment for soldiery employed by Töregene, or to buy the loyalty of the locals, this 
issue was quickly melted and reused. The last known coinage from this mint was struck in the name of the Great Khan Möngke, after which 
this mint disappears from the numismatic records.

Although the Timurids struck an abundant silver coinage, with both Sunni and Shi&apos;a religious legends, examples of their gold coinage are 
exceedingly rare. Presumably this coin, with its outstandingly graceful calligraphy, was struck for ceremonial occasions. Husayn Bayqara 
chose to encourage and preside over a brilliant cultural and political life in Harat, whose &quot;beh bud&quot; (&quot;prosperity&quot;) motto is proclaimed on the 
reverse of these coins. He became famous for the artistic excellence of his surviving buildings, and as a patron of the arts, who encouraged 
the intellectual and artistic life of Harat, and wrote his own poetry in both Persian and Turkish. Despite the words &quot;Allah ta&apos;aala&quot; (&quot;God the 
most high&quot;) on the obverse of this coin, Husayn Bayqara was not a religious zealot. He issued Sunni coins in Sunni areas and Shi&apos;a coins 
in Twelver Shi&apos;a areas, and offended the pious with his neglect of the prescribed prayers, refusal to fast and enjoyment of wine. By AH 906 
(1501) the style of rule made the fall of the Timurids inevitable. The Uzbek Sunni ruler Muhammad Shaybani conquered Samarkand, while 
the Shi&apos;ite Shah Isma&apos;il I laid the foundations of the great Safawid empire. One year after his death, the Shaybanis entered Herat and Husayn 
Bayqara&apos;s sons fled the city.

As a type, the glockentaler (bell taler), appears to reflect the changing sentiment of the leadership of the Dukes of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel 
during the Thirty Years&apos; War (1618-1648). In 1622, Christian von Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel (1616-1626), issued an unusual series of 
doppeltalers and talers (see Davenport 6319-6323). Reputedly minted from silver plate taken from the Imperial abbey of Corvey, this type 
features religious legends in both French and German. The reverse depicts God&apos;s right arm extending from the clouds, armored and holding 
a sword that may, or may not, support a crown. In keeping with Christian&apos;s aggressive advocacy of the Protestant cause, the German reads 
GOTTES FREVNDT DER PFAFFEN FEINDT (God&apos;s friend; the priests&apos; enemy). By the time of Auguste der Jüngere, however, German 
territories, including Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel, had been the site of much of the devastating fighting during the war. The departure in 1634 
of the imperial armies from his territories was a cause of celebration. To commemorate this event, a series of seven taler types were struck. 
Collectively known as glockentalers, since a bell features prominently into the design of six of the types (the fourth type shows a stone block 
and a bell clapper), all of these coins have the common reverse legend ALLES MIT BEDACHT (everything with deliberation), which suggests 
that the consequences of the impulsive policy of Christian von Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel and almost twenty years of devastation, brought 
sober reflection with the onset of peace.

4-5; Wright -; KM 119C.1. Near VF, struck with worn die, areas of minor roughness, a few marks, ex jewelry. Exceedingly 
rare, none on CoinArchives. Of important historical and iconographic interest. 
($150,000) 

The Falcon mMohur is the earliest of the highly desirable iconographic issues of Akbar and his son Jahangir. It was struck to commemorate the 
capture of the mighty fortress of Asir, principal stronghold of the Khandesh sultanate, on 17 January 1601 CE (AH 12 Rajab 1009). Akbar&apos;s 
trusted Grand Vizier, Abu&apos;l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, author of the celebrated Akbarnama, led the Mughal army during the six-month siege. The fall 
of Asir precipitated the conquest of the Deccan and thus vastly extended Akbar&apos;s dominion in India. It was said that a great treasure was found 
in the fortress and this was perhaps the source of the bullion for the Falcon mohurs. The issue, however, was very small. Only seven examples 
are traceable today, four of which are in museumcollections, all struck from the same, single pair of skilfully engraved dies. The Falcon mohur 
was the sole product of the mint at Asir. 

Why a falcon should be chosen for the obverse type remains something of a mystery. In his catalogue of the British Museum collection, 
Stanley Lane-Poole wondered if the falcon was chosen &apos;in allusion to the conquering swoop of the besiegers.&apos; Falconry was a favorite sport 
of the Mughal court. Falcons appear frequently in Mughal art, particularly miniatures. 

Zodiac Mohurs 

In the 29th year of his reign, the Mughal emperor Akbar (1556-1605) established the Din-e Ilahi (literally faith of God), a syncretic belief 
system that incorporated elements of the different religious beliefs in his empire. Immediately thereafter, Akbar began counting his reign in 
accordance with the tenets of this new belief system. Known as the Ilahi Era, dating was now based on a solar, rather than lunar, calendar with 
the year divided into twelve Ilahi months. 

Akbar&apos;s early successors continued to employ this dating system. Jahangir (1605-1628), Akbar&apos;s son and immediate successor, used the Ilahi 
Era to great artistic effect by issuing two series of mohurs that incorporated Ilahi Era elements. The earliest series, known as the portrait series, 
since the coins show the emperor on the obverse, all show the constellation Leo superimposed over the sun -a reference to Jahangir&apos;s birth 
in August. This series was struck within a three-year span early in Jahangir&apos;s reign and are quite rare. The second series, known as the zodiac 
series, since each of the twelve constellations of the Zodiac is represented on the reverse, was a much larger series. Struck both in gold and 
silver, the zodiac series was issued from several mints (with Agra being the primary), and like the previous series, minted over three or four 
years. Since the Ilahi months were solar months and corresponded with the solar ecliptic (an imaginary line in the sky that marks the annual 
path of the sun), each month was represented by an appropriate sign of the Zodiac, recording its particular month of issue. 

Because many of these coins had been recalled and melted by Jahangir&apos;s successor, Shah Jahan, original strikes are very rare. Collector 
restrikes were periodically issued over the following century, and though they are more often encountered than the originals, are relatively 
rare themselves. Numismatists have divided the portrait and zodiac series mohurs into four classes: 

Class A: undisputed original strikes, characterized by deep relief, somewhat uneven flans, and rounded calligraphy. 
Class B: possibly original strikes, but more likely minted in the first decade or two following Jahangir&apos;s death. The relief is shallower, of a 
more uniform appearance, and the calligraphy is more square. 
Class C: mohurs of Class A or B that have had the zodiac type removed and re-engraved. 
Class D: later imitations and forgeries.

Previously to this, the rule of the coinage was that on the face of the metal they stamped my name, and on the reverse the name of the place 
and the year of the reign. At this time it entered my mind that in place of the month they should substitute the figure of the constellation which 
belonged to that month...in each month that was struck, the figure of the constellation was to be on one face, as if the sun was emerging from it.

The reverse of this coin depicts the Fontana del Pantheon, the original of which was erected under pope Gregory XIII. The fountain took 
its current shape in 1711, when Baroque sculptor Filippo Barigioni was commissioned to update the design, incorporating a large Egyptian 
obelisk. The obelisk had initially been carved under Pharoah Ramses II (1279-1213 BC) for use in the Temple of Ra at Heliopolis, and was 
later brought to Rome and used in the ancient Iseum Campense.

Frederick II Hohenstaufen, &quot;Stupor Mundi&quot; (&quot;Wonder of the World&quot;), was the most enlightened ruler of the medieval European world, and 
single-handedly almost ignited a renaissance a century before it took hold in western Europe. Besides encouraging the study of both the 
ancient and natural worlds (he wrote an insightful treatise on falconry), Frederick was instrumental in improving relations with the Muslims, 
negotiating free access to Christian holy sites in Palestine, where all Crusader armies had been unsuccessful. One of his innovations was a 
gold coinage comparable in style and quality to the gold of the ancient Caesars. The classical motifs proclaimed his inheritance of the legacy 
of Rome, and the augustale and its fractions were issued concurrently with the publication of the Constitution of Melfi, his codification of 
Norman law meant to follow the famous Roman law codes. These coins were struck until Frederick&apos;s death in 1250, and may have been 
continued by his successors for about another fifteen years.

Found Birchington, Kent, 2017. 

Of the enigmatic Pada series of thrymsas first classified by Stuart Rigold in his seminal 1960 study, type P IIB is by far the rarest. The obverse 
shares with type P IIA a bust based on a Constantinian prototype with a distinctive wreath made from a &apos;special cloven punch&apos;. On the reverse 
however the Runic inscription PADA has been replaced with a Cross on steps, a common Byzantine motif first encountered in the Anglo-
Saxon series on the fine gold Benitugo type Thrymsa. Only two other specimens are known of the P IIB type: one, found in a grave in Dover, 
was considered as possibly imitative by Michael Metcalf on grounds of style and metal content; and the example in the BM, acquired privately 
in 1926, with which our coin is die linked.

While several of the beautiful portraits of Offa appear to have been inspired by Roman prototypes, the depiction of the king on the coin offered 
here, with its schematically rendered nude bust and long, closely pleated hair is, as Michael Dolley commented, &apos;more redolent, perhaps, 
of his Germanic past&apos;. The reverse device, at times described as a &apos;dragon headed wreath&apos; and a &apos;serpent torque&apos;, has aroused considerable 
comment. The dragon, so often the jealous hoarder of treasure in Anglo-Saxon and Norse mythology, is encountered in the thrymsa and sceatta 
series. Here it protectively encircles the name of the moneyer, and serves as an entirely appropriate choice of reverse for this masterpiece of 
Dark Age art.

Our understanding of the cross and lozenge coinage of Alfred the Great and his contemporary Ceolwulf II of Mercia has been transformed by 
the discovery of the Wattlington Hoard in 2015. This extremely important hoard of some 200 coins, jewellery and hack silver was acquired by 
the Ashmolean Museum after a major fund raising campaign. The cross and lozenge coinage is now firmly recognized as a joint issue of the 
kings of Wessex and Mercia acting in unison under extraordinary circumstances as their territories were ravaged by marauding Viking armies. 
Though Mercia was unable to withstand the onslaught Alfred held firm and turned the tide against the foreign invaders, laying the foundations 
for a new, united kingdom of England in the struggle.

The Battle of Hastings, fought on 14 October 1066, is one of the decisive events in English history. The death of Harold II, felled famously 
by an arrow in the eye, marked the end of some 500 years Anglo-Saxon rule and civilization. On Christmas Day 1066, the victor, William, 
Duke of Normandy, was crowned in Westminster Abbey and by the 1070 the Norman conquest of England was effectively complete. In his 
new realm William found a highly efficient monetary system that he wisely retained. Kolsveinn, the Anglo-Saxon moneyer who struck this 
penny at Hastings for the Conqueror, previously struck coins for Edward the Confessor. As a man of considerable status and wealth Kolsveinn 
is likely to have been a first hand witness to the momentous events of 1066. He may well have fought in the battle.

Humphrey Sutherland praised the restraint and foresight of the unknown master who designed this type, who &quot;in age when sumptuous 
decoration of all redundant space was the normal fashion, was content -and dared -to leave the field totally devoid of ornament within its 
encircling tressure. By this means he concentrated upon this larger and more personal portrait, so lifelike in its almost voluptuous forms, an 
emphasis which the Italian artists themselves were only just beginning to estimate and enjoy.&quot; Art In Coinage, p. 154.

The end of the Burgundian alliance in 1435 and loss of Paris to the forces of Charles VII the following year left the English position in France 
in a perilous state. The consequent economic decline resulted in a steep decline in output, particularly of gold, from the English mints.

The association of disease with evil and the employment of the laying-on of hands to cure that disease/evil has been a part of human belief since at 
least the time of Jesus and the miracles associated with him. Among the numerous diseases that existed in medieval and modern Europe, one of the 
most heinous and virulent was the so-called morbium regis, or, as it was known in French, mal de roi -the King&apos;s Evil. A form of scrofula, a tubercular 
infection of the lymph nodes that left untreated turned into suppurating sores. While various home remedies were known, the one perceived certain 
cure was the laying-on of hands by the king in his role as the anointed representative of Christ. Beginning in France under Robert II (996-1017) and 
in England under Edward the Confessor (1042-1066), this ritual became an important part of kingship and also a crucial test of royal legitimacy. 

As a part of the ritual, the afflicted would receive a coin as alms. Because of its association with this ritual, the coin would be kept to act 
as a talisman for the sufferer. By the time of Edward IV, the coin used was a gold denomination, the angel, that was perfectly suited for the 
ceremony as it bore a depiction of the Archangel Michael slaying the Dragon on the obverse and the royal ship-of-state -an allusion to the 
monarch -on the reverse. Under Henry VII (1485-1509), the practice was ritualized into a Divine Service and the coins themselves were a 
central part of the ceremony, retaining their relative intrinsic purity. Having first been threaded with a ribbon for suspension, the coin would 
be passed over the affected areas by the monarch, who would sometimes make the sign of the cross with the coin as well. Even after England 
had become a Protestant country, Queen Elizabeth I (1558-1603) continued to do the latter. 

Under the Stuarts, the ceremony took on special significance since they viewed it as an important component of their increasingly absolutist 
view of the divine right of kingship. While James I (1603-1625), owing to his Protestant background and the lack of such a ritual in Scotland, 
initially balked at performing the ritual, he soon acquiesced, although he removed everything in the ritual that remotely smacked of papism 
and invoked God in the actual healing. Under James I and Charles I (1625-1649), the coin itself underwent significant design changes to the 
reverse, including under Charles the replacement of the traditional legend with a more ironic one -AMOR POPVLI PRAESIDIVM REGIS 
(The People&apos;s Love is the King&apos;s Safeguard). Like his father, Charles I performed the ceremony only on Easter and Michaelmas, as well as on 
Progresses. In 1633, a few days after his Scottish Coronation, Charles touched about 100 people. To commemorate this event, special angels 
designed and struck by Nicholas Briot were used. During his captivity following the end of the Civil War, Charles continued to perform 
touchings; the coins and ribbons were supplied by those wanting to be touched. 

Under the Commonwealth, both the denomination and the ceremony ceased. When the ritual was reintroduced during the Restoration of 
Charles II (1660-1685) and his successors, a gold medalet, now specifically a touch-piece, was created to replace the angel. Designed solely 
for the touching ceremony and not meant to be used as currency, this medalet continued to employ the designs of the former angel (although 
now the ship was now modernized by depicting the Sovereign of the Seas accompanied by the legend SOLI DEO GLORIA (Alone to God the 
glory). The last reigning monarch to touch on British soil was Anne (1702-1714), who did so three months before her death. The Hanoverians 
refused to participate at all and the ritual died out in England, although in France it did so until the execution of Louis XVI (1774-1793), and 
was continued by the Stuart Pretenders until the death of Cardinal Henry Benedict Stuart, Henry IX to the Jacobites, in 1807.

The rare silver Pounds struck at Oxford from vigorously engraved obverse dies by Thomas Rawlins are among the most impressive and 
desirable coins of the entire British series. Few have a pedigree as early as the example offered here which was once in the collection of Sir 
Francis Willougby the Younger (1668 -88). Willougby had an unhappy childhood losing his father Francis, a founder of British ornithology, 
at the age of four. In 1676 his mother married the powerful merchant and politician Sir Josiah Child who, as Governor of the East India 
Company, prosecuted a war against the Mughal Empire, later known as Child&apos;s War. Willougby ran away from home at the age of 12 and 
took his stepfather to court claiming that Sir Josiah had squandered his inheritance. He formed a varied collection of coins that included an 
important group of issues from the English Civil War and the Great Rebellion in Ireland. On Willougby&apos;s untimely death in 1688 the collection 
passed to his younger brother, Thomas, and remained intact until sold by Sotheby&apos;s in 1926.

Richard was the son of William I Longsword and grandson of the Viking chieftain Rollo, the founder of the duchy. He was a child when 
his father was murdered by Arnulf of Flanders in 942, and was nearly killed soon thereafter, when the Carolingian king of France, Louis 
IV d&apos;Otremer, invaded Normandie with Hughes le Grand, count of Paris. He faced another crisis when Louis&apos; successor, Lothaire, invaded 
with the counts of Anjou, Blois-Chartres, and Flanders in the 960s. Richard made peace with his neighbors at Gisors in 965, and thereafter 
concentrated on solidifying his rule in Normandy by making family alliances with the various Scandinavian tribes in the region. He also 
gained ecclesiastical support by promoting Christianity and rebuilding a number of churches. Richard was first married to Emma, daughter of 
Hughes le Grand, but she died young, and childless. He had a number of children with his second wife, Gunnor, including his heir, Richard II 
le Bon, and Emma of Normandy. Through Emma&apos;s marriage to two kings of England, Aethelred II the Unready and Cnut the Great, Richard 
was grandfather of the English kings Harthacnute and Edward the Confessor. Through his son, Richard II, Richard was the great-grandfather 
of William &apos;the Conqueror.&apos;

Handbook of Coins of Italy and Magna Graecia 

Hoover, Oliver D. Handbook of Coins of Italy and Magna Graecia, Sixth to First Centuries BC [The Handbook of 
Greek Coinage Series, Volume 1]. 2018. lxxii and 597 numbered pp. Hardbound. (GR) (GR 330) $65 

More than three decades have passed since David Sear published Greek Coins &amp; Their Values, his revision of Gilbert Askew&apos;s 
A Catalogue of Greek Coins published by B. A. Seaby in 1951. Since then, the field of ancient numismatics and the hobby 
of collecting ancient coins have changed so much that now Greek Coins &amp; Their Values would require a complete revision 
to include all of the most current numismatic information available, list the many new types and varieties unknown to Sear, 
and determine an approximate sense of rarity for all of these issues. In order to encompass this new material and create a 
viable reference for the beginning and specialized collector, such a handbook would have to be more than the two volumes 
which Sear found necessary. As a result, Classical Numismatic Group is publishing The Handbook of Greek Coinage Series, 
written by Oliver D. Hoover, in a series of 13 volumes, each covering a specified area of Greek coinage with the first being 
The Handbook of Syrian Coins: Royal and Civic Issues, Fourth to First Centuries BC (Volume 9 in the series). This series is 
designed to aid the user in the quick, accurate, and relatively painless identification of Greek coins, while providing a cross-
reference for each entry to a major work, which will allow the inquirer to pursue more in-depth research on the subject. The 
subject-matter of each volume is arranged chronologically for royal issues, and regionally for the civic issues; within each 
region, cities are listed directionally, depending on the region. For those rulers or cities that issued coins concurrently in 
all three metals, these issues will be arranged in the catalog with gold first, followed by silver, and then bronze; each metal 
is arranged by denomination, largest to smallest. Known mints for the royal coinage are listed below the appropriate type, 
making an easy search for a specific mint. Each entry will include a rarity rating based on the frequency with which they 
appear in publications, public and private collections, the market, and/or are estimated to exist in public or private hands. 
No valuations are listed, since such values are generally out of date by the time of publication. An online valuation guide at 
www.greekcoinvalues.com will allowing interested individuals the opportunity to gauge the market, and reduce the need 
for repeated updates of this series. Whether one purchases the entire set for their reference library, or the individual volume 
pertaining to one&apos;s area of specialization, The Handbook of Greek Coinage Series should provide a useful staging-point from 
which collectors and interested scholars can pursue their research and interests. 

The latest published volume in the series is Handbook of Coins of Italy and Magna Graecia, Sixth to First Centuries BC 
(Volume 1 in the series). Beginning with Ancona in Picenum, the catalog covers Italy and Magna Graecia from north to south, 
with each region in alphabetical order. The coinage within each city is arranged chronologically, beginning with the Archaic 
issues and continuing through the later civic issues. Issues in this catalog are arranged with silver first, followed by bronze; 
each metal is arranged by denomination, largest to smallest.
