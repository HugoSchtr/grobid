AUCTION TERMS 

This is an internet/mail bid sale with an automated electronic close, conducted 
by Classical Numismatic Group, LLC (CNG). Bidding in the auction consti-
tutes acceptance of the following terms: 

1. The property listed in this catalogue is offered for sale by CNG for itself 
and as agent for various owners and other consignors. We reserve the right to 
reject any bid, to determine the opening price, to set bidding increments, to 
vary the order of the auction, to reopen bidding in the case of a dispute, to 
withdraw any lot, to bid on behalf of CNG, to bid on behalf of the consignor, 
and to permit the consignor to bid on his own lots. CNG may loan or advance 
money to consignors or prospective bidders, and may have an interest other 
than commission charges in any lot. CNG may bid on its own account as an 
&quot;insider&quot; with information not available to the public. 

2. Lots will be sold in the order listed in the catalogue. The first lot will close 
electronically at www.cngcoins.com in the morning Eastern Time on the sale 
date, with subsequent lots closing every 20 seconds thereafter. All written, fax, 
email and phone bids must be received by 5PM Eastern Time, on the day prior 
to the sale date. Electronic bids may be placed by approved bidders up until 
the closing time of each lot. The electronic clock on the website represents the 
official closing time for each lot. Bidders intending to bid electronically must 
first register at www.cngcoins.com. New website registrations are processed 
for approval Monday through Friday 9AM-5PM Eastern Time only. No new 
registrations will be approved on the sale date. 

3. A 22.5% Buyer&apos;s Fee will be added to the hammer price of all success-
ful written, fax, email and phone bids. A 20% Buyer&apos;s Fee will be added to 
the hammer price of all successful electronic bids directly placed on www. 
cngcoins.com. 

4. All coins are guaranteed genuine. Attribution, date, condition and other 
descriptions are the opinion of the cataloguer, and no warranty is expressed or 
implied. Please note that an auction sale is not an approval sale. Lots exam-
ined prior to the sale and lots purchased by floor bidders (including bidders 
executing commission bids on behalf of other parties) may not be returned for 
any reason except lack of authenticity. All claims of misdescription and all 
claims of return, except claims regarding authenticity, must be made within 
5 days of receipt of material. Any claim of lack of authenticity must be made 
in writing by the original purchaser immediately after discovery that an item 
is not authentic, and upon making such a claim the original purchaser must 
immediately return the lot to CNG in the same condition as at the time of the 
auction. Coins that have been encapsulated (&quot;slabbed&quot;) by a grading and/or 
authentication service may not be returned for any reason, including authen-
ticity, if they have been removed from the encapsulation (&quot;slab&quot;). If payment 
is made by credit card, rights of return are governed by these Auction Terms 
which supersede any rights of return promulgated by the card issuer. Estimates 
are intended as a guide only and not as a statement of opinion of value. 

5. Invoices are due and payable immediately upon receipt. Interest and late 
fees of 2.0% per month, or at the highest rate permitted by law, whichever 
is less, from the date of the auction, shall be payable on invoices not settled 
within 30 days of the auction date. Payment may be made by check or bank 
wire. Credit cards (Visa or MasterCard) will be accepted; credit card payments 
will not be accepted more than 14 days after the sale date. Payment by credit 
card for printed sale auctions will be charged a 2.5% handling fee. Payment 
by check must be made in either US dollars ($) drawn on a US bank or British 
sterling (£) drawn on a British bank. All successful bidders outside North 
America and the United Kingdom will be charged an additional $20 fee for 
bank charges that are the result of international wire transfer fees; this fee will 
be deducted for credit card or check payment as described above. CNG may 
reduce or compromise any charge or fee at its discretion. 

6. Bidders not known to us must provide satisfactory credit references or pay 
a deposit as determined at CNG&apos;s discretion before bidding. Minors are not 
permitted to bid without written consent of a parent guaranteeing payment. 
CNG may require payment in full from any bidder prior to delivery of lots. 
Title does not pass until lots are paid in full. Upon receipt of lots, the buyer 
assumes full responsibility for loss or damage. Delivery to the buyer&apos;s address 
of record shall constitute receipt by the buyer regardless of the identity of the 
person accepting delivery. 

7. Estimates are in U.S. dollars ($) and bids must be made in even dollar ($) 
amounts. The CNG website, www.cngcoins.com, will execute electronic bids 

on behalf of all electronic bidders. Subject to reserves and opening prices, all 
electronic bids will be executed by the electronic software at one bidding incre-
ment (approximately 10%) over the next highest bid. All written, fax, email and 
phone bids received before 5PM the day prior to the sale date will be uploaded 
to the CNG website no later than the day prior to the sale date. These bids will 
not be subject to the minimum required bid cited on the website at the time of 
the upload. Any written, fax, email and phone bids received after the deadline 
or with special instructions will be executed at CNG&apos;s complete discretion and 
will be subject to the next bid required by the website. In the case of identical 
written, fax, email and phone bids, the earliest bid received wins. An electronic 
bid has priority over any identical written, fax, email or phone bid. Bid by lot 
number. No lot will be broken. Bidders are responsible for errors in bidding. 
Check your bids carefully. Electronic bidders may check their bids under User 
Services at www.cngcoins.com. 

8. A word on Reserves. CNG may place a reserve on any lot. However, no 
reserve will be higher than the estimate, and ordinarily lots are reserved at 
60% of estimate. 

9. Bidders personally guarantee payment for their successful bids, including 
bidders executing commission bids from other parties and bidders representing 
corporations or other entities. Buyers accepting commission bids from other 
parties do so at their own risk and remain responsible for payment under these 
Auction Terms. 

10. In the event a successful bidder fails to make full payment within 30 days 
of the auction date, CNG reserves the right to deem the sale incomplete and 
to resell the material, and the bidder agrees to pay for the reasonable cost of 
such a sale and also to pay any difference between the resale price and the 
previously successful bid. CNG reserves all rights that it is entitled to under 
the Pennsylvania Uniform Commercial Code, including the right to offset any 
sums due from a successful bidder against any future consignment or purchase 
or monies or goods in possession of CNG. 

11. Sales tax, postage, handling and insurance are the responsibility of the 
buyer and are added to all invoices where appropriate. For buyers in the 
European Union, CNG may import lots into the United Kingdom prior to 
shipment and charge buyers the import Value Added Tax. On any tax not paid 
by the purchaser which should have been paid, even if not invoiced by CNG, 
the purchaser agrees to pay the same on demand together with any interest or 
penalty that may be assessed. It is the responsibility of the buyer to comply 
with foreign customs and other regulations. 

12. Prices realized are published and are mailed with CNG&apos;s next publication. 
Prices realized are posted at www.cngcoins.com and successful electronic bid-
ders are notified by email after the last lot of the sale closes. 

13. Bidders hereby waive any claim for incidental, consequential or exemplary 
damages arising from this auction. The sole remedy that any participant in the 
auction shall have for any claim or controversy arising out of the auction shall 
be a refund, without interest, of all or part of the purchase price paid by the 
participant. 

14. All rights granted by CNG or otherwise available to bidders and purchasers, 
under these Auction Terms or otherwise, are personal and may not be assigned 
or transferred to any other person or entity, whether by operation of law or 
otherwise. No third party may rely on any benefit or right conferred by these 
Auction Terms. Bidders acting as agents must disclose the agency in writing to 
CNG prior to the auction; otherwise rights are limited to the agent and are not 
transferable to the undisclosed principal. 

15. Any dispute regarding this auction shall be governed by the laws of 
Pennsylvania and shall be adjudicated only by the Lancaster County Court 
of Common Pleas or the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of 
Pennsylvania; all bidders submit themselves to the personal jurisdiction of 
these courts for this purpose, consent to service of process by registered or 
certified mail, and waive any contrary provisions of Articles 14 or 15 of the 
French Civil Code and any similar provisions in any jurisdiction. All bidders 
consent to the confidentiality of consignors&apos; identities and waive any right to 
require disclosure of the name of the consignor or owner of any auction lot, 
whether such right is based on New York GOL  §5-701(a) or any other provi-
sion in any jurisdiction. In any dispute regarding this auction, the prevailing 
party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorney fees. 

All written, fax, email and phone bids must be received by 5PM (ET) May 28, 2019. 

The Electronic Close starts at 10AM ET on May 29, 2019. Lots close every 20 seconds.

Christina &quot;Tina&quot; Jordan has announced her retirement after 24 years at CNG&apos;s London office. 

I met Tina and her husband John about 1990 when they were living in the San Francisco Bay area and were enthusiastic members of the San 
Francisco Ancient Numismatic Society. It was always a pleasure to see them, but little could I have guessed that our future paths would take 
parallel courses. 

CNG opened its London office in 1991, and I moved from Los Angeles to London. It was not long before the happy coincidence that John&apos;s 
work took him and Tina to London as well. Tina had a background in bookkeeping, and we were pleased that she agreed to join CNG as 
our London bookkeeper in 1995. I am sure she did not realize that she would still be with us over 20 years later. When John retired, he and 
Tina decided to remain in London, and so CNG had the good fortune that Tina has stayed with us, persevering from the days of handwritten 
accounts and faxes to the days of ledgers housed on the company servers. 

But everyone who has worked in our office --and many of those who have visited --will know that Tina has not only been our reliable and 
hardworking bookkeeper. She has also been the person who always arrives with a smile and a good word, and retains her sunny disposition 
regardless of the press of work or the inevitable stresses of a busy office. She has combined her conscientious commitment to work with her 
gentle, kind, and occasionally quirky outlook on life, and has contributed greatly to CNG&apos;s success while at the same time being simply a 
pleasure to work with. 

We send Tina and John our heartfelt thanks and best wishes for the future, and we will hope to see them as often as their own travel schedules 
and busy lives permit. 

Eric McFadden

Ex CNG inventory 156350 (January 2005). 

From the earliest issues of the coins of Akragas, there are instances where the engraver of a reverse die appears to have synthesized a human 
face into the features of the carapace of the crab, as here. In fact, Westermark notes many examples, and agrees with the observations of 
others that even the likenesses of various animal heads are likewise occasionally engraved in the design. She also agrees that the most likely 
interpretation is that the human-like face is that of the river god Akragas, displayed within the features of the very emblem that is meant to 
represent him on the city&apos;s coinage. This phenomenon continued to recur on silver issues of the city throughout the fifth century, culminating 
in the spectacular issue of rare drachms in the third period of coinage, where the features of the carapace are totally transformed into a stark

The artist who signed this issue was among the many &quot;signing artists&quot; who engraved coins in Syracuse from the late Second Democracy to 
the reign of Dionysios I. He is better known from his signed tetradrachms (Fischer-Bossert, Coins [Tudeer] 67), but also a rare issue of small 
bronze (CNS 29 fr2). This issue should not be confused with the slightly later issue of AV litrai of the same types, which are quite common

Although since the late 6th century BC relations between Rome and Carthage had always been maintained on a friendly basis, Rome&apos;s 
growing influence in Magna Graecia in the early decades of the third century BC led inevitably to an increasing rivalry between the two 
powers. The Italian state was being drawn inexorably into the bitter politics of the centuries-old dispute between Greeks and Carthaginians 
in Sicily. This magnificent medallic piece was issued at about the time of the outbreak of the First Punic War which, after almost a quarter of 
a century of fighting, was to bring about the end of the Carthaginian presence on the island. Find spots for these coins have been exclusively 
Sicilian, and they were presumably struck for military purposes. Although horses had always been popular on Carthaginian and Siculo-
Punic issues, the depiction of the winged Pegasos represented a departure from tradition. The influence of the Corinthian coinage and that of 
her colony Syracuse seems obvious. The typically enigmatic Punic inscription translates &quot;in the land,&quot; and the Carthaginian stronghold of 
Panormos on the north coast of western Sicily has been suggested as the mint for this impressive series.

This type is normally found on clearly billon flans, but this coin appears to be struck on a much higher quality metal. There are traces of an 
undertype visible, what appears to be the tail and hind legs of a horse standing right, with an unclear control mark between the legs, but none 
are distinct enough to suggest a particular issue, though it is almost certainly Carthaginian.

From the Colin E. Pitchfork Collection. 

The Bisaltai were a tribe of Pelasgian or Thracian origin and occupied the territory between the rivers Echedoros and Strymon, including the 
metalliferous mountains, which separate the territory of the Bisaltai from the territory of the Krestonioi and Mygonia on the west (Herodotos 
7, 115). At the time of the invasion of Xerxes in 480 BC, the Bisaltai were governed by a Thracian ruler who was independent of Macedonian 
influence, and refused to assist the Great King of Persia when his army crossed Thrace to invade mainland Greece. At some point after the 
Persian retreat, Alexander I of Macedon, who was in the service of Persians as early as 492 BC, annexed the territory as far as the Strymon 
valley. Capturing its rich silver mines, he issued the first regal Macedonian coinage, which is indistinguishable from the Bisaltian but for the 
placing of his own name. The absence of Bisaltai oktadrachms in the Asyut hoard led Price and Waggoner to suggest a mintage date of circa 
475-465 BC. This coinage was terminated about the same time as the disaster at Drabeskos in 465/4 BC, in which the Athenian colonists of 
Ennea Hodoi (later Amphipolis) were exterminated by the native Thracians, though it is unknown whether this coinage is directly related to 
the Bisaltai&apos;s involvement in this conflict.

holding wreath in extended right hand and cradling stylis in left arm; kerykeion below right wing. Price 3458 (Sidon, same 
obv. die as illustration); Newell, Dated 2, obv. die H (Sidon). Near EF, lustrous, small nick and scuff on reverse. From the 
earliest series of staters of Alexander. Very rare. 
($2000) 

This issue was originally given to Sidon by Newell, along with seven other issues of staters (and two distaters) that lacked the mint signature 
and/or date that is found on nearly all other issues at Sidon. Newell later doubted the attribution, and suggested they may belong to an early 
mint at Damaskos (cf. G.F. Hill, &quot;Alexander the Great and the Persian lion-gryphon,&quot; JHS 43 [1923], p. 159). While Price retained Newell&apos;s 
original attribution, he, too, remained skeptical (Price, p. 436). Le Rider, in his recent review of the coinage of Alexander the Great (Alexander 
the Great: Coinage, Finances, and Policy [Philadelphia, 2007]), recounted the various arguments, but also assimilated more recent research, 
and convincingly argues that these eight issues of gold actually were the first issues of Alexander type staters at the mint of Tarsos (Le Rider, 
op. cit., pp. 134-9). 

The reattribution to Tarsos has a significant effect on the importance of these staters. It is generally thought that Alexander began issuing his 
new coinage, staters of Athena/Nike type and tetradrachms of Herakles/Zeus type, shortly after his capture of Tarsos in 333 BC. Recognizing 
the importance of this mint for Alexander, supported by the state of the evidence at the time, Newell originally attributed a large series of 
staters to the early period of Alexanders at Tarsos (E.T. Newell, &quot;Tarsos under Alexander,&quot; AJN 52 [1918]). Later research, however, moved 
nearly all of these issues to a mint in Macedon (cf. Price p. 371, and Troxell, Studies, pp. 99-110). This void of gold coinage is therefore filled 
with the reattribution of the eight issues from Sidon, resulting in these being not only the first issue of Alexander staters from Tarsos, but the 
first issues of Alexander&apos;s new stater coinage anywhere.

This beautiful gold stater belongs to the period following the death of Alexander the Great when his half-brother, Philip III Arrhidaios, was 
the nominal head of state together with the conqueror&apos;s infant son by Roxane, Alexander IV. The gem-like delicacy of the engraving of these 
extraordinary dies singles this issue out as belonging to one of the mints of the Ionian coastal region of western Asia Minor, an area which, of 
course, was not controlled by the Macedonian monarchy in the time of Philip II. Kolophon is the city to which it is tentatively attributed, the 
tripod symbol linking it to an issue in the name of Philip III (cf. Price P41).

134. 
KINGS of PAEONIA. Patraos. Circa 335-315 BC. AR Tetradrachm (23.5mm, 12.90 g, 9h). Astibos or Damastion

($1000) 

The obverse head on this particular issue is quite unlike the standard appearance of Apollo on most of Patraos&apos; issues, leading to speculation 
in most references that it is actually a portrait of the king. There is also a parallel within the coinage of Patraos&apos; predecessor, Lykkeios, where 
a few known tetrobols have a portrait generally regarded to be that of the king rather than Apollo (see AMNG III/2, p. 201, 13).

Pantikapaion was founded by Greek colonists from Miletos in the late seventh century BC. Situated on the west side of the Cimmerian 
Bosporos, in what is now called the Crimea, it achieved great prosperity through its exploitation of the abundant fisheries of the straits and the 
export of wheat from the Crimea. This wealth is attested by its splendid gold coinage, which commenced in the mid-4th century BC, and by 
the magnificently furnished rock tombs of its principal citizens in the same period. Later, it was to become a regional capital of the kingdom 
of Mithradates VI of Pontos (120-63 BC) and later still the seat of the kings of Bosporos (first century BC -fourth century AD). The coinage 
of Pantikapaion seems to have commenced with silver issues in the latter part of the fifth century BC, but it is for its beautiful gold staters that 
the mint is chiefly noted. They depict the head of the god Pan (a pun on the name of the city) and on the reverse the griffin that Herodotos 
describes as being the guardian of the remote sources of gold.

Pharnakes was awarded the Bosporan Kingdom by Pompey, for the betrayal of his father Mithradates VI, King of Pontos. Little is known 
of his 16-year reign except for its ending. During the Civil War between Pompey and Julius Caesar, Pharnakes tried to recapture his father&apos;s 
former territories in Pontos. He won a victory over Caesar&apos;s general, Domitius Calvinus, and ordered Romans in the region castrated or put to 
the sword. In response, Caesar launched a rapid five day war against Pharnakes in 47 BC, culminating in the battle of Zela. Caesar emerged 
victorious, prompting him to report back to the Senate with the now famous dictum, &quot;Veni, Vidi, Vici&quot; (I came, I saw, I conquered).

After defeating Pharnakes II in 47 BC, Asander hoped that Caesar would recognize him as king of Bosporos. Instead, in 46 BC Caesar 
appointed Mithradates of Pergamon, the illegitimate son of Mithradates VI Eupator and a personal friend. Asander, however, subsequently 
defeated and killed Mithradates. To support his claim to the throne, Asander married Dynamis, the daughter of Pharnakes II, but for the first 
four years of his reign, he claimed the title &apos;archon&apos; only, rather than that of &apos;basileus.&apos; The reason for this may be that as Rome had formally 
recognized the archon Pharnakes II as king, Asander was hoping they would do the same on his behalf -a hope confirmed by Octavian in 43 
BC. Consequently, all of Asander&apos;s regnal dates are reckoned from his first year as archon (circa 47/6 BC).

Electrum of Kyzikos 

The celebrated electrum coinage of Kyzikos began in the first half of the sixth century, and from the beginning the coinage was notable for 
the variety and inventiveness of its designs. These staters and fractions were regarded as gold coins and circulated throughout a large area 
along with the gold darics of the Persian Empire. On all of the coins of Kyzikos, large or small, was engraved the tunny-fish (θυννος), 
which constituted an important product in the Kyzikene economy. The long awaited corpus initiated by the late Friedrich Bodenstedt is now 
being continued by Maria Kaiser-Raiss. In the meantime, we must rely on the synthesis of material put together by Hans von Fritze in 1914, 
augmented (and corrected) by the articles by Sylvia Hurter and Hans-Joachim Liewald. Hurter studied the electrum coinage of Kyzikos for 
some time before her untimely death in 2008. It was her conviction that the arrangement of the coins by Agnes Baldwin Brett in the catalog of 
the Boston Museum of Fine Arts was the most accurate to date (reflected in the &quot;Editor&apos;s note&quot; at the beginning of the article on the Kyzikene 
coins in Moscow and St. Petersburg in SNR 2007). Thus, the coinage of Kyzikos below is arranged accordingly. 

More controversially, Yuri Pokras (&quot;A New Iconography for the Electrum Coins of Kyzikos,&quot; The Celator November 2000, pp.18-26) has 
tried to argue that Athens invested Kyzikos with the status of subsidiary mint, and that the presence of specific types parallels each city-state&apos;s 
inclusion into an alliance with Athens. 

The orator Aristotelis, in the second century BC, stated the following in his speech regarding the people of Kyzikos: &quot;It is enough for one 
just to glance at the location and the nature of this city to immediately understand that the name &apos;blissful&apos; given to it by God was factual, so 
convenient is its land and its sea. As it is built in front of Asia Minor and since its dominion extends from the Black Sea to the Hellespont, 
Kyzikos joins the two seas together or rather all the seas that man navigates. Thus, ships continuously pass by or arrive at the harbor or depart 
from the harbor. Justly it should be called &apos;blissful&apos; just as is Corinth because, as it is built in the mid part of the seas, it joins, as if it was the 
center of the world, all men who sail the Mediterranean from Gibraltar to Kolchis at the far side of the Black Sea.&quot;

The portrait on this particular issue is thought to be Attis, the consort of Phrygian Kybele. The androgynous Kybele/Agdistis was castrated by 
the gods. From the severed parts grew an almond tree from which Attis sprang. Attis appears infrequently in Greek art, but he was raised in 
status when the Romans adopted the cult of Kybele.

This extremely rare hekte type depicts the legend of the omphalos (navel) stone, which marked the sacred precinct of the sanctuary of Apollo 
at Delphi as the physical center of the earth. According to tradition, two eagles, which had been released by Zeus, one flying from the east, and 
the other from the west, met exactly at the site of Apollo&apos;s sanctuary. This spot was marked for all to see by the stone omphalos, and designated 
as the center of the earth. The omphalos was a white stone ornamented with stripes of various kinds, and upon it were the representations 
of the two eagles (as seen on this coin type -the tunny fish below is the city-badge of Kyzikos). This scene was frequently represented in 
vase-paintings, but is extremely rare on coinage. The omphalos probably stood on the sacred hearth, which was in the center of the temple. 

While the same design is also found on full staters, only two other hektes of this type are recorded in CoinArchives.com. One was sold by 
Tradart S.A. on 18 December 2014 for 26,000 Euro ($31,925) hammer, and the second by Roma Numismatics Ltd. on 26 September 2018

When Lysimachos established the mint of Pergamon, he entrusted its treasury to the eunuch Philetairos. Philetairos changed his allegiance 
to Seleukos I, probably shortly before the Battle of Korupedion in 281 BC, where Seleukos defeated Lysimachos. Although Seleukos 
was assassinated the following year, Philetairos struck a series of Alexander-type issues in the name of Seleukos. Philetairos continued to 
acknowledge Seleukid primacy for some time, but soon struck a coinage in his own name. This coinage featured Athena Nikephoros on the 
reverse, similar to the reverses of Lysimachos. Perhaps because this move might have been viewed as a threat by his Seleukid overlord, the 
obverse of the first issues of these coins featured the portrait of Seleukos I. Houghton &amp; Lorber (SC), citing Le Rider and Newell, assign 
this coinage to the aftermath of Antiochos I&apos;s victory over the Galatians, circa 269/8 BC. Near the end of Philetairos&apos; reign, in the mid-late 
260s, the portrait of Seleukos was replaced with the portrait of the Pergamene king, noting a final break from Seleukid authority. Similar 
to what was done in Ptolemaic Egypt, all of the subsequent kings of Pergamon continued to use these types on the coinage, and even kept 
Philetairos&apos; name. Distinguishing the issues between the various rulers has been difficult for numismatists. Westermark&apos;s die study of the 
coinage, however, provided the key necessary for understanding the series, although more recent hoard evidence has refined Westermark&apos;s 
assignment of the issues.

that have a frontal eye, as here (see, e.g., CNG E-245, lot 144). It is likely that these represent the earliest issues for this period. The cataloger

The name on this issue is the same as that on an issue of stephanephori that was struck circa 150-140 BC. Whether these two issues name the 
same individual is uncertain. In his study of the stephanephoroi of Magnesia, Jones connected that individual with the neokoros of the temple 
of Artemis Leukophryene named in an inscription dated to 112/1 BC (IC III iv 9). If this is correct, then it would be reasonable to assume that 
this individual was also responsible for the present issue of staters. It is also possible that these similarly-named individuals were two members 
of the same family, such as a grandfather and grandson. 

The appearance of this previously unknown issue at Magnesia adds another city of western Asia Minor to the list of those that struck a gold 
coinage in the late Hellenistic period. Previously, such issues were known at Ephesos, Miletos, Smryna, and Tralles. Until Jenkins&apos; study 
of the Ephesos staters in 1987 (see Jenkins, Hellenistic), all of these were previously thought to have been issues struck in celebration of 
Mithradates VI&apos;s liberation of the cities from Roman control. With the exception of Smyrna and a discrete portion of the issues of Ephesos, 
all are now known to have been struck in the mid-late 2nd century BC, as there are direct parallels between the staters and various cistophori 
struck in their respective cities. All of these staters are civic in nature, featuring the patron deity of the city on the obverse, and reverses 
referencing aspects of each city&apos;s particular civic identity. 

The fact that Magnesia did not strike cistophori is one aspect that separates the present issue from the other cities&apos; gold. Thus, the dating 
of the issue relies upon the assumption that the &quot;magistrate&quot; named is the same as that found on the stephanophoroi, as noted above. The 
reverse design also distinguishes this issue. While the obverse is unexceptional, featuring the same profile portrait of Artemis found on the 
stephanephoroi and later bronze issues, the reverse with Nike driving a fast biga is quite perplexing, as it does not apparently represent an 
aspect of the civic mythology or identity, but rather an actual event. The type likely commemorates some victory that had a local significance, 
but our knowledge of Magnesia&apos;s history in the second century BC is scant. There are no political or military actions that are known for 
the period, but the type may be related to the games of the Leukophryena, which was an important panhellenic festival in honor of Artemis 
Leukophryene. If the &quot;magistrate&quot; named on the coin is the individual who held the position of the temple neokoros in 112/1 BC, then such 
a connection is quite likely.

58 (both sales attributing to Samos). 

The obverse type is found among the archaic fractions at the Ionian cities of Miletos (cf. SNG Kayhan 455-61) and Samos (cf. Barron p. 
175, 1 [there called a panther]). The style is nearly identical in both instances, and both are enclosed in a dotted square border. The weight 
of the present coin, however, does not fit the standard used at either city during the time those issues were struck. Also, both of these cities 
had established reverse types for their silver coins when those issues were struck, so the use of a typeless incuse here is unlikely if the coin 
was from either issue. The weight of this early issue is more consistent with an Aeginetic drachm, which suggests a possible attribution to a 
Carian mint, although it is also found at the Ionian mint of Teos.

Rare and Intriguing Seleukeia Mint Tetradrachm 

341. 
SELEUKID EMPIRE. Alexander I Balas. 152-145 BC. AR Tetradrachm (31mm, 15.74 g, 4h). Seleukeia in Pieria 
mint. Dated SE 166 (147/6 BC). Head of Zeus right, with full beard and hair arranged in long curls of archaizing form, wearing 
laurel wreath / ∫Å%5¬EW% Å¬E$Å@droU, thunderbolt; 4$r (date) and ‹ above, » and Ä below; all within laurel wreath 
with ties to right. SC 1798; Houghton, Tetradrachm, dies A1/P3; HGC 9, 874; DCA 124; SNG Fitzwilliam 5686 (same dies); 
CSE 409 (same obv. die); Getty Museum 78.NB.374 (same obv. die); Gulbenkian 1711 (same obv. die); Pozzi 2980 (same

approximately fifteen known examples, of which at least seven are in museums. 
($3000) 

This tetradrachm struck by Alexander Balas is among the most intriguing of the Seleukid series. Unlike the usual royal tetradrachm issues that 
dominate the series, this coin employs types that are directly related to the city in which it was struck. Seleukeia was well noted for its cult 
of Zeus Casios, and there are also reports that a thunderbolt cult existed there (Appian, Syr. 58). Moreover, the idealized, Pheidian-influenced 
portrait of Zeus and the winged thunderbolt had been types struck on municipal bronze issues of Seleukeia from the establishment of the city 
under Seleukos I. 

This novel issue is likely a reflection of the prominence of the city under Alexander. At the beginning of his reign, immediately following his 
overthrow of Demetrios I, Seleukeia was the first city in northern Syria under his total control. In contrast, Antioch refused to accept him, and 
struck a series of posthumous coins in the name of Antiochos IV. Without having control of the Antioch mint, Alexander was forced to begin 
striking coinage at Seleukeia, which had been only a peripheral mint in earlier reigns. Although there is no known event in SE 166 that would 
give rise to such a special coin issue, the purely civic nature of the types strongly suggests that the city retained a level of high prominence 
during the later years of his reign. 

Fewer than ten examples have appeared at auction in the past 20 years.

($15,000) 

Year 4 shekels are decidedly rarer than those of Years 1-3, reflecting the deteriorating military and political situation of the Judean rebels. 
While surviving shekels of each of the first three years number in the hundreds, fewer than 50 survive for Year 4. The Jewish forces, 
increasingly confined to the environs of Jerusalem, were suffering severe shortages of everything from precious metals to foodstuffs, meaning 
there was far less silver available to strike coins, and very little in the way of goods for them to be spent buying. The dies used for striking 
coins also show signs of haste in preparation. This specimen appears to have a noticeable metal defect, or &quot;delamination,&quot; in the obverse 
field left of the chalice; however, this same &quot;metal flaw&quot; appears on the only other known specimen struck from this obverse die (sold in 
Heritage 3005, May 2009, lot 20062), indicating it is a raised area in the die itself. Normally such a die flaw would have been abraded and 
polished away before striking, but here it was apparently overlooked or not viewed as important enough to correct, all indications of mounting 
difficulties at the mint.

Outstanding Siege Half Shekel 

383. 
JUDAEA, Jewish War. 66-70 CE. AE Half Shekel (26mm, 15.22 g, 12h). Jerusalem mint. Dated year 4 (69/70 
CE). Etrog flanked by two lulav bunches; ¥ßH o@RF ¡3c (&quot;year four half&quot; in Hebrew) around / Palm tree with two date 
bunches, flanked by baskets of dates; 3X¥ß ¡L!GL (&quot;to the redemption of Zion&quot; in Hebrew) around. MCP FJR 13, dies 
O1/R-(unlisted rev. die); Meshorer 211; Kadman 32; Hendin 1367; Bromberg 74 (same obv. die); Shoshana I 20214-5; 
Sofaer 39; Spaer 179-80. Good VF, earthen dark green-brown patina, minor flan flaw on obverse. Excellent fields. Very rare, 
and among the finest examples known. 
($5000) 

By Year 4 of the Jewish War (69/70 CE), the Romans had gained the initiative and the rebellion was in dire straits. The Jews of Jerusalem 
were desperately short on supplies and engaged in bloody internecine battles for political control of the remaining rebel forces. The shortage 
of precious metals witnessed a severe drop in the number of silver shekels and their fractions from the temple mint (see previous lot). It also 
resulted in what has been called the world&apos;s first issue of &quot;siege coins.&quot; This consisted of bronze coins intended to circulate along with the 
silver shekels, inscribed &quot;half&quot; and &quot;quarter,&quot; along with a much smaller denomination without a value that is surely an eighth-shekel. The 
large half-shekels are, by far, the rarest of these, with surviving specimens numbering in the mid thirties. The symbolism of the bronzes is 
distinct from that of the silver shekels, emphasizing Feast of Tabernacles on the holy day of Sukkot. Here the obverse depicts two lulavs 
(bound palm branches) and an etrog (citron fruit), while the reverse depicts a seven-branched palm tree (perhaps symbolizing the Menorah) 
flanked by two date baskets. The Paleo-Hebrew reverse inscription &quot;to the redemption of Zion&quot; marks a departure from previous coin slogans 
calling for the &quot;freedom of Zion,&quot; perhaps indicating awareness that the flame of freedom would soon be snuffed out by the Romans, and that 
any salvation would be more spiritual than physical. 

384. 
PHILISTIA (PALESTINE), Askalon(?). Mid 5th century-333 BC. AR Drachm (17mm, 3.61 g, 4h). Head of female

($500) 

From the Johnson Family Collection. Lot includes an old Seaby Coin &amp; Medal Bulletin entry for this coin from the 1950s-60s. 

The reverse of this issue copies that of the famous Athenian dekadrachms, underscoring the impact of the design even as far as the southern 
Levant. Although the style of this issue closely resembles that of similar types at Askalon, the issues attributed to that city all have a portion 
of the ethnic in the field on the reverse. Thus, this could be an issue from one of the other cities in the region.

The Double Darics of Babylon 

The mint, date of issue, and purpose for the distinctive &quot;Archer&quot; double darics have been long debated. The types are drawn from the later 
series of Persian darics, which showed a running figure (often referred to as the Great King) holding a spear and bow on the obverse. In the 
double daric design, however, the King&apos;s robe has a border of beading along the bottom, and the reverse features a somewhat symmetrical 
wavy design. Since the late nineteenth century, numismatists who have studied this coinage have generally agreed that they were struck after 
the death of the last Persian Great King, Dareios III, in 330 BC, based on the commonality of the control marks on these coins that also appear 
on Alexandrine issues from the Babylon mint. The ending date, at the beginning of the reign of Seleukos I, has not been controversial. 

These conclusions remained unchallenged until H. Nicolet-Pierre re-examined the series in her 1999 article, &quot;Argent et or frappés en Babylonie 
entre 331 et 311 ou de Mazdai à Séleucos&quot; in Travaux Le Rider. There, she argued that, in conjunction with a series of silver staters that shared 
control marks, as well as the coins&apos; style and manufacture, she concluded that the double darics were struck in Babylon. The metal analysis of 
the double darics, however, showed a distinct difference from that of the Alexander type staters struck there, which suggested that they were 
not intended to circulate together, nor were they struck for the same purpose. Nicolet-Pierre also departed from the prior conventional wisdom 
that these coins were struck from the time of Dareios&apos; death, placing their issuance after the death of Alexander in 323 BC. 

In a more recent study, G. Le Rider (in Alexandre le Grande: Monnaie, Finances et Politique [Paris, 2003]) challenged Nicolet-Pierre&apos;s 
revised dating of the series. Her revised dating was based on an earlier study of a hoard of eastern Athenian imitations that she co-authored 
with M. Amandry. In that study, the co-authors had concluded that the ΣTA MNA found on some of the tetradrachms, also found on some 
of the double darics, were two names, with the second perhaps being a patronym. As possible candidates for the ΣTA they considered three 
individuals: Stamenes, the satrap of Babylon from 328-323 BC; Stasanor, the satrap of Drangiana from 328-321 (and Areia from 323), and 
then satrap of Baktria and Sogdiana from 321-circa 317; and, finally, Stasander, the satrap of Areia and Drangiana from 321 (he disappears 
from the historical record after 317). Since Nicolet-Pierre thought the double darics marked M-ΛY were the first issue, which must be after 
Alexander&apos;s death, this eliminated Stamenes of Babylon, and Stasanor during his tenure in Drangiana and Areia. Le Rider, while accepting 
the possibility of her dating, focused on the MNA portion of the inscription, which he thought may be associated with the same MNA found 
on the Athena-Eagle coins that traditionally had been assigned to Sophytes and dated from before Alexander&apos;s death. If correct, this would 
preserve the earlier chronology that favored a series of issues struck by the satraps of Babylon from Mazaios to Seleukos. 

The question of the beginning of the series remained open until the recent analyses of the coinage of Sophytes by B. Kritt (in The Seleucid 
Mint of Aï Khanoum [Lancaster, 2016]) and S. Jansari (&quot;The Sophytes Coins: From the Punjab to Bactria and Back Again&quot; in NC 178 [2018]), 
convincingly placed all of the Sophytes coinage after 323 BC. As such, it appears that the later chronology proposed by Nicolet-Pierre is 
correct. However, her designation of the M-ΛY issue as the earliest is based on a subjective interpretation of the relative chronology of all the 
issues, some of which do not share exact control marks as they are on any Alexandrine issues, and these, in Le Rider&apos;s view, may be earlier. 

With little doubt, the double darics were struck in Babylon, circa 328/3-311 BC, alongside a series of silver staters with which it was 
connected through the use of common control marks and struck on a local, Persic standard. These control marks also find parallels among 
the Alexander type coinage, but their different metal content and weight standard suggest that they are products of either different mints or 
officinae in Babylon. Nicolet-Pierre suggested that the Alexander coinage and the staters and double darics were struck at separate mints 
(Nicolet-Pierre, p. 302). Such a division of the mint into two workshops under Seleukos I was already identified by the authors of SC (SC I 
pp. 39-40 and 43-5). As noted by Nicolet-Pierre (with which Houghton and Lorber concur), the mint (or workshop) that produced the coins on 
the local Persic standard had a special connection to the satrap, which was explicit under Seleukos, whose personal badge, an anchor, became 
a constant symbol on the coinage produced there. The fact that the coins were struck on the local standard suggests they were meant for some 
element of the local population, whereas the Alexandrine issues from the &quot;imperial&quot; mint (or workshop), struck on the Attic standard, were 
meant for payments that circulated in the west, as evidenced by the fact that most of these coins are found in western hoards. 

Alexander&apos;s use of distinctly Persian types would seem to be counterintuitive, since it is generally assumed that he would impose his own 
types and convert the local economy to the Attic standard on his conquered territories. Modern studies of Alexander&apos;s policies, however, 
show that Alexander was conservative in the way he administered his conquered territories by preserving local customs and norms as much 
as possible. With few exceptions, local coinages continued to be used for local transactions throughout his empire, and darics remained the 
common gold currency for the rare cash transactions of this region. The precise reason that a double daric denomination was created, though, 
remains a mystery. Nonetheless, by using a Persian type featuring Greek letters and monograms, the issue is a visual representation of the 
marriage of Eastern and Western influences in Alexander&apos;s empire.

Remarkable Achaemenid Imitation of Athens 

411. 
EGYPT, Achaemenid Province. temp. Artaxerxes III Okhos -Sabakes. Circa 343/2-333 BC. AR Tetradrachm 
(21mm, 16.99 g, 9h). Imitating Athens. Head of Athena right, with profile eye, wearing crested Corinthian helmet with pi-style

Good VF, attractively toned, a hint of die wear, light scratch under tone on reverse. Excellent metal. 
($750) 

From the Ealing Collection. 

This remarkable Athenian type tetradrachm combines an obverse of the earliest pi-style type with the reverse of the classical period types, 
but with the A of the ethnic placed high in the upper right corner, a characteristic that defied convention at Athens since the early 5th century. 
On closer examination, the style of the obverse die is a perfect match to those used from the Type III tetradrachms of Artaxerxes III through 
the Type III tetradrachms of Sabakes struck in Egypt (cf. Van Alfen pl. 7, 121-35, and Van Alfen, Fourth, pl. 50, 39-41). The style of the owl 
is also consistent with that found on those pieces, and the flan is of similar thick composition. The sole difference is that this coin bears the 
ethnic of Athens, and the reverse type is in an incuse square. While it is tempting to suggest that this may be the earliest of the imitations 
struck under Artaxerxes, the relative chronology of the dies in the Persian series does not support such a placement. An attractive alternative 
is that this coin was part of a parallel series struck under the Achaemenid administration that retained the city ethnic, perhaps to satisfy the 
requirements of the intended recipient of this coinage.

Very Rare Countermark of C. Numonius Vala 
Legate of Quinctilius Varus

GERMANIA INFERIOR. C. Numonius Vala, legate. AE As (26mm, 10.19 g). Countermark applied during the

Host Fine, c/ms VF, brown patina. 
($200) 

This countermark is traditionally attributed to P. Qunctilius Varus, Augustus&apos; infamous general and governor of Germania, who suffered 
a devastating defeat when legions under his command were annihilated in the Battle of Teutoberger Forest. However, Martini (Pangerl p. 
l [for English version]) notes the existence of one example of this countermark applied over a Tiberian TIB stamp from Gaul, indicating 
that this type must date to after the defeat of Varus. Other suggested interpretations of the monogram include LAP (Legatus Augusti [pro] 
Praetori), AVR(elius), or V(ictoria) A(ugusta) R(omana), or that it does indeed refer to Governor Varus, but as some sort of posthumous 
commemorative. None of these explanations are particularly convincing. See Pangerl p. xlvii-li for a detailed discussion of the countermark 
and its context.

GERMANIA INFERIOR. AE As (25mm, 8.02 g). Countermarks applied during the reign of Tiberius, AD 14-37.

Purchased from Empire Coins, April 1983. 

MacDowall describes this type as a barred X, and gives it to Legio X Gemina. Pangerl follows Kos, reading the countermark as XI for Legio 
XI Claudia. In the late summer of AD 69, that legion was stationed at Poetovium in Pannonia, where a number of these coins have been found.

Refining the Chronology of NCAPR 

486. 
MOESIA &amp; THRACE. AE Sestertius (38mm, 26.31 g). Countermarks applied during the reigns of Nero to Vespasian, 
circa AD 54-79(?), and Galba, April-June AD 68. NCAPR (Nummus Caesare Augusto PRobatus?) and GALBA in rectangular 
countermarks on a sestertius of Agrippina Senior. For NCAPR: Pangerl 60 (applied in Italy). For GALBA: Pangerl 86; Martini 
1.4006-11, 2.1429-33. Host Fine, c/m&apos;s VF, green patina. A rare and important combination of countermarks. 
($300) 

Purchased from Hermes Coins. 

This important coin provides further refinement to the chronology of the NCAPR countermark. Previously believed to be applied during the 
reign of Nero, an example in the Pangerl collection appears on an as of Vespasian, necessitating a later date for the series. The present example, 
however, bears a GALBA countermark that was clearly stamped at a later date. This indicates that the NCAPR countermark was applied 
continuously from before the Civil War into the reign of Vespasian.

Originally founded as one of four Panhellenic Games during the sixth century BC, the first Pythian Games were said to have been held by 
Apollo in penance for the killing of Python at Delphi. With gymnastic, athletic, music, and poetry competitions, the games evolved to display 
the very best of Graeco-Roman culture and traditionally drew visitors from across the empire. Illustrated on the reverse of this coin is the 
agonistic table showing the victors&apos; prizes: two victory crowns, representing the Action and Pythian Games, the two local contests held in the 
city of Perinthus. Traditionally made of bay leaves, which were sacred to Apollo, the leaves for the crowns were taken from the sacred tree in 
the Vale of Tempe in Thessaly. Between them are two palm fronds, and below, apples and an amphora.

Lucian of Samosata describes in detail the Hierapolitan cult images of Haddad and Atargatis (whom he refers to as Zeus and Hera) in his De 
Dea Syria (31-33), a &quot;guidebook&quot; of sorts to the deities&apos; temple in Hierapolis and the cult practices taking place there. His description of the 
statues of Atargatis, Haddad, and the mysterious &quot;symbol&quot; comports wonderfully with the figures as they appear on this type: 

The great temple is open to all; the sacred shrine to the priests alone and not to all of these, but only to those who are deemed nearest to the 
gods and who have the charge of the entire administration of the sacred rites. In this shrine are placed the statues, one of which is Hera, 
the other Zeus, though they call him by another name. Both of these are golden, both are sitting; Hera is supported by lions, Zeus is sitting 
on bulls...between the two there stands another image of gold, no part of it resembling the others. This possesses no special form of its own, 
but recalls the characteristics of other gods. The Assyrians themselves speak of it as a symbol (Greek σημεῖον), but they have assigned it 
no definite name. They have nothing to tell us about its origin, nor its form: some refer to it as Dionysus; others to Deukalion; others to 
Semiramis; for its summit is crowned by a golden pigeon, and this is why they allege it is the effigy of Semiramis.

Aulus Gabinius, Legate to Pompey 

510. 
SELEUCIS and PIERIA, Antioch. Aulus Gabinius. Proconsul, 57-55 BC. AR Tetradrachm (27mm, 15.34 g, 12h).

By the time Aulus Gabinius became tribune of the plebs in 67 BC, Cilician pirates had overrun the eastern Mediterranean as the major 
dynasties that had ruled over the territory since the death of Alexander the Great fell into decline. Although Rome saw steep inflation and even 
faced famine as a result, the Senate was reluctant to assign any one commander to deal with the issue as the senators feared this would grant 
too much power to a single individual. With unrest against the Senate reaching a tipping point, the tribune Aulus Gabinius was able to push 
through his Lex Gabinia de piratis persequendis, which authorized Pompey to wage war on the pirates, effectively placing the commander 
in control of the East. 

Gabinius subsequently served as legate to Pompey and was integral in mediating in affairs in Mesopotamia and Judaea. He became pronconsul 
of Syria in 57 BC, during which time he reorganized Judaea and rebuilt a number of cities, while quashing revolts led by Aristobolus and 
Alexander Jannaeus and reinstating Hyrcanus II as high priest. In 55 BC, Pompey instructed Gabinius to lead his troops to Egypt to restore 
Ptolemy XII, an ally of the Romans, after the king was expelled and replaced by his sister Berenice. This move would prove fateful, as he 
left Syria for Egypt by order of Pompey but without the consent of the Senate. As a result, he was charged with treason, but was acquitted. 
The Senate did, however, find him guilty of extortion for his acceptance of 10,000 talents from Ptolemy as payment for restoring him to the 
Egyptian throne. Gabinius&apos; was sent into exile, but was recalled by Julius Caesar in 49 BC. He died of illness in circa 47 BC at Salona (modern 
Solin, Croatia, a short distance from Split).

Pescennius Niger was proclaimed emperor by his troops while serving as governor of Syria in AD 193, and issued coins primarily from the 
mint of Antioch, though coins also exist from Alexandria and some provincial mints. At the same time as it was manufacturing denarii and 
aurei, the Antioch mint also did double-duty and issued tetradrachms. In his book, Prieur noted only one example of this particular type; only 
one other piece has been sold at auction since (CNG Mail Bid Sale 81, 813). Niger did not have long to issue coins of any denomination: in 
194, Niger was defeated by Severus and died of his wounds. The Historia Augusta says that his head was put on a pike and sent to Rome, his 
wife and children were murdered, and his estates confiscated.

Five Uranius Antoninus Tetradrachms

The little that is known about the usurper Uranius Antoninus comes entirely from his coinage. He came to power in the East in AD 253 during 
a period of great crisis and upheaval for the Roman Empire. At this time, the Sasanian king Shapur I made many incursions into Roman 
territory, even capturing the great city of Antioch, apparently just to show that he could: his armies burned and pillaged the communities in 
their path and took people and plunder back to their own territory. It may be that Uranius Antoninus came to power in order to defend his 
community from attack rather than out of any anti-Roman antipathy. He issued coins from the mint at Emesa, some of which feature the sacred 
stone of El-Gabal, which might indicate that Uranius was part of the Emesene royal family of priest-kings. The coins are dated in accordance 
with the Seleucid dating system, which is reflective of the region&apos;s historical status as part of the Seleucid Empire. As with many usurpers, 
Uranius Antoninus&apos; reign did not last long, and he fell from power before Valerian I came eastward in AD 254.

COELESYRIA, Chalcis ad Libanum. Herod. AD 41-48. AE (27mm, 14.36 g, 12h). Caesarea Maritima mint. Dated

($2000) 

Continued Herodian support of the Romans allowed the dynasty to extend its influence beyond Jewish territories. Herod V, the grandson of 
Herod the Great, was granted the kingdom of Chalkis by Claudius in 41 upon the request of Agrippa I, and all of Herod&apos;s rare coins name 
the emperor. His friendship with and loyalty to the emperor continued to benefit him; following the death of Agrippa in 44, Claudius granted 
Herod authority over affairs at the Temple in Jerusalem, a right he retained until his death some four years later.

The reverse of this scarce issue depicts Sabina as Demeter (or perhaps Isis-Demeter if she is wearing an Isis crown instead of a stephane). It 
is also interesting to note the difference in the spelling of her name between the obverse and reverse (CABINA versus CABЄINA), which 
clearly indicates a lack of consistency among the engravers.

Sarapis was a syncretic god, combining Hellenistic Greek and Egyptian religious beliefs. His name is of Egyptian origin and derives from a 
synthesis of Ausar (Greek, Osiris), the Egyptian god of the Underworld, and Hapi (Greek, Apis), a manifestation of the god Ptah. Under the 
Ptolemies, Sarapis became the chief tutelary god and the subject of a royally-sponsored cult, whose emphasis on an afterlife made the worship 
of Sarapis one of the more popular mystery cults. His immense popularity soon extended to his creation as Sarapis-Pantheos, a hybrid deity 
incorporating other divine elements. In the case of the present specimen from the Staffieri collection, he is depicted with the radiate crown 
of Helios, his own kalathos, the ram&apos;s horn of Ammon, and the trident of Poseidon entwined with the serpent of Asklepios. In Alexandria, a 
large temple complex, called the Serapeum, was constructed and remained highly patronized well into the fourth century AD. Shortly after the 
imperial decree of AD 391, officially declaring pagan temples closed, the Serapeum was besieged, plundered, and destroyed.

The Great Sothic Cycle was a calendrical cycle based on the heliacal rising in July of the star Sirius (known to the Greeks as Sothis) and lasting 
approximately 1460 years. According to ancient Egyptian mythology, in a Golden Age, the beginning of the flooding of the Nile coincided 
exactly with the rising of Sirius, which was reckoned as the New Year. Only once every 1460 years did Sirius rise at exactly the same time. 
Thus, the coincidence of this along with the concurrent beginning of the flooding of the Nile gave the event major cosmological significance 
by heralding not just the beginning of a new year, but the beginning of a new eon. This event also was thought to herald the appearance of the 
phoenix, a mythological bird which was reborn every 500 to 1000 years out of its own ashes. According to one version of the myth, each new 
phoenix embalmed its old ashes in an egg of myrrh, which it then deposited in the Egyptian city of Heliopolis. So important was the advent 
of the new Great Sothic Cycle, both to the realignment of the heavens and its signaling of the annual flooding of the Nile, that the Egyptians 
celebrated it in a five-day festival, which emphasized the important cosmological significance. 

In the third year of the reign of Antoninus Pius (AD 139/40), a new Great Sothic Cycle began. To mark this event, the mint of Alexandria 
struck an extensive series of coinage, especially in large bronze drachms, each related in some astrological way to the reordering of the 
heavens during the advent of the new Great Sothic Cycle. This celebration would continue throughout Pius&apos; reign, with an immense output of 
coinage during the eighth year of his reign in Egypt, which included this coin type, part of the Zodiac series.

Rome&apos;s military successes in the later stages of the Second Punic War, especially the capture and sack of Syracuse, enabled her to undertake 
a fundamental reform of the coinage in 211 BC. This included the introduction of a series of three small gold denominations valued at 60, 
40, and 20 asses. The types were identical in each case: a bearded head of Mars, god of war, on the obverse, and an eagle on thunderbolt 
(representing Jupiter) on reverse. The issue extended over a period of about three years and Rome seems to have been the principal mint.

As consul for the year 88 BC, Sulla was awarded the coveted assignment of suppressing the revolt of Mithradates VI of Pontus, but political 
maneuvers resulted in this assignment being transferred to Marius. In response, Sulla turned his army on Rome, captured it, and reclaimed his 
command against Mithradates. His prosecution of the first Mithradatic War was successful, but he spared the Pontic king for personal gain. 
In 83 BC, Sulla returned to Italy as an outlaw, but he was able to win the support of many of the leading Romans. Within a year he fought his 
way to Rome, where he was elected dictator. It was during this campaign to Rome that this denarius was struck. The obverse type represents 
Sulla&apos;s claim to be acting in Rome&apos;s best interest. The reverse shows Sulla enjoying the highest honor to which a Roman could aspire, the 
celebration of a triumph at Rome.

Although the moneyer Q. Pomponius Musa is unknown to history, his choice of Hercules Musagetes and the nine Muses as coin types is 
remarkable and clearly connected to his cognomen. 

The reverses of this series -Hercules playing the lyre and the Muses, can be none other than the celebrated statue group by an unknown 
Greek artist, taken from Ambracia and placed in the Aedes Herculis Musarum, which was erected by M. Fulvius Nobilior in 187 BC after 
the capture of Ambracia in 189 BC (Plin. NH xxxv.66; Ov. Fast. vi.812). By the second century BC, Rome had overrun most of Greece and 
was captivated by Hellenic art and culture, not the least of which was its sculpture. Fulvius is said to have taken the statues to Rome because 
he learned in Greece that Hercules was a musagetes (leader of the Muses). Remains of this temple have been found in the area of the Circus 
Flaminius close to the southwest part of the circus itself, and northwest of the porticus Octaviae. An inscription found nearby, &apos;M. Fulvius 
M. f. Ser. n. Nobilior cos. Ambracia cepit&apos; may have been on the pedestal of one of the statues. The official name of the temple was Herculis 
Musarum Aedes, which Servius and Plutarch called Herculis et Musarum Aedes.

Antony and Octavian, still sporting youthful long sideburns, on opposite sides. While Antony occupies the dominant obverse, Octavian calls 
himself by the potent name Caesar, soon to become a title for future Roman emperors.

($1000) 

This denarius type is usually attributed to Colonia Patricia (modern Cordoba) in Spain. The obverse depicts the elaborate regalia (ornamenta 
triumphalia) of a successful general that is awarded to him on the occasion of his procession through the streets of Rome as triumphator. The 
toga picta was an elaborate dress based on the attire of the Etruscan kings and is shown being worn over the tunica palmata, a tunic decorated 
with representations of palm leaves. On either side are seen a legionary eagle, symbolic of the Roman army, and a triumphal wreath, or corona 
triumphalis. This was worn by the triumphator as he paraded through the streets of the capital in the elaborately adorned chariot, which is 
depicted on the reverse. 

In 19 BC, Augustus returned to Rome after a three-year absence in Greece and Asia, and this reverse type probably relates to the celebration 
of the military successes of this period, especially Tiberius&apos; activities in Armenia and the restoration of the standards that the Parthians had 
captured from Crassus in 53 BC.

The Deified Julius Caesar

Augustus, with Divus Julius Caesar. 27 BC-AD 14. AR Denarius (19.5mm, 3.31 g, 8h). Rome mint; M. Sanquinius,

comet with four rays and a tail. RIC I 338; RSC 1 (Julius Caesar and Augustus). Good VF, toned, surface marks and light 
porosity. 
($1000) 

The idealized head on the reverse has been variously identified as a deified and rejuvenated Julius Caesar, Augustus himself, or a male 
personification of the dawning Golden Age. The presence of a comet above the head, likely intended as the &quot;Julian star&quot; that appeared shortly 
after Caesar&apos;s death, argues for the first identification.

($3000) 

The cistophoric tetradrachm was introduced by the Attalid kings of Pergamum in the 190s BC, and was intended for circulation only within a 
closed economic region in western Anatolia. Its name derives from the cista, or sacred basket containing serpents, that appeared on the obverse 
of the first issues. The Pergamene Kingdom was later bequeathed to Rome in 133 BC as Asia Province and the coinage continued, with the 
local design gradually supplanted by portraits of Roman rulers. It was theoretically a tetradrachm (4-drachm piece) on the reduced Asian 
standard of about 3 grams per drachm; however, its weight was also equivalent to three Roman denarii, so it could also have passed current 
in the western provinces as a triple denarius piece. Whether cistophori were used in the west in this fashion is a matter of ongoing debate.

Despite being among the worst of all Roman emperors, Caligula issued coinage that was both innovative and attractive. On the reverse of 
this sestertius, issued early in his reign (AD 37-38), he is shown in his role as Pontifex Maximus, performing a sacrifice before the temple of 
his deified maternal grandfather, Divus Augustus. The architectural details visible on this rendering are quite instructive, from the fluted Ionic 
columns of the portico, to the sacrificial scene on the architrave frieze mirroring the foreground scene, to the row of statues along the roof 
line. Caligula properly wears his toga drawn up over his head and holds the curved knife he will use to sacrifice the bull being brought to the 
altar behind him. The propaganda message is double-barreled: Gaius is as pious and dutiful as his forebears, one of whom is now among the 
immortals.

This reverse type commemorates the protection of Nero from the Pisonian Conspiracy. Events of the years AD 64-65 defined the subsequent 
reputation of Nero as a cruel and self-indulgent ruler. His &quot;excesses&quot; resulted in a conspiracy to overthrow and replace him with Gaius 
Calpurnius Piso. Among the conspirators were many high-ranking members of Nero&apos;s court including Seneca the Younger, the poet Lucan, 
and Petronius, who called himself Nero&apos;s &quot;arbiter of elegance.&quot; To Nero, the failure of a conspiracy made up of those so close to him could 
have been achieved only through divine intervention. As the king of the Gods oversaw the security of the Roman state, Nero believed it was 
Jupiter the Guardian (Custos) who had saved him from harm.

Ex Numismatica Ars Classica 40 (16 May 2007), lot 666. 

Central to the prosperity of the Roman state was the Temple of Vesta, one of the oldest and most sacred temples in Rome. Its distinctive, 
circular architecture was reminiscent of the fact that the worship of Vesta, goddess of the hearth, originally took place in the privacy of 
the home. Never officially consecrated, the temple housed the sacred, undying fire, upon which the fate of Rome lay and, within the inner 
sanctum, &quot;sacred things that may not be divulged&quot; purportedly including the Palladium, brought from Troy by Aeneas, as well as important 
state documents. Tended to by the Vestal Virgins, whose purity and dedication was seen to guard the city from danger, it was said that if the 
fire were to be extinguished it would be interpreted as &quot;an omen that portends the destruction of the city.&quot; Ironically perhaps, the temple was 
destroyed by fire and subsequently rebuilt on numerous occasions, including after the great fire of AD 64, supposedly started by Nero himself. 
Historical accounts, including that of Ovid, state that there had previously been no cult statue within the temple and earlier coins depicting the 
temple appear to corroborate this, such as the denarius of Q. Cassius Longinus and the rare dupondius of Augustus. Although it is possible that 
the newly built temple did contain a statue, such as is depicted here, Philip Hill suggests that the more likely explanation is that this reverse 
shows the Aedicula Vestae on the Palatine Hill, a small shrine erected near the house of Augustus in 12 BC which, although also destroyed 
and rebuilt after the great fire, incorporated a new shrine of Vesta within it.

The coinage series celebrating the Flavian dynasty&apos;s success in the Jewish War circa AD 66-73 was the broadest and most diverse issue 
of coins celebrating a Roman victory issued up to that time, comprising coins of every metal, denomination, and mint. They formed an 
important part of the overall propaganda campaign establishing the legitimacy of the regime, which had itself come to power as the result 
of a destructive civil war. The Gallic mint of Lugdunum, modern Lyon, produced this aureus with the inscription DE IVDAEIS (the DE 
abbreviating DEVICTA -&quot;Judaea conquered&quot;), from mid AD 72 to 73. During this period the last stronghold of the Judaean rebels, the 
mountaintop citadel of Masada, was placed under siege by the Roman governor of Judaea, L. Flavius Silva, leading Legio X Fretensis. After 
a titanic effort in constructing an immense siege ramp (with most of the labor provided by captive Jews), the Romans broke into the fortress 
on April 16, AD 73 only to find the defenders had committed mass suicide. Nevertheless, the Romans erected a trophy composed of enemy 
arms and armor, as on the reverse of this aureus, to commemorate their last victory of the long, bloody conflict.

According to Curtis Clay, the primary purpose of restored coins was to provide substitutes in circulation for coin types that had become 
familiar, but that the emperor was calling in, melting down, and restriking, because the originals were worn out and sometimes also because 
they contained more precious metal than current coins, so the Roman state could make a profit. When selecting the types for the restored coins, 
however, a secondary purpose kicked in: to present a full picture of earlier Roman coinage, and to honor worthy earlier emperors, even if the 
earlier coins in question were not actually being called in and restruck, either because they were so old that they were no longer in circulation, 
or because they were so recent that they were still in excellent condition and contained no more bullion than the mint&apos;s current production. 
This secondary purpose explains Trajan&apos;s restoration of both a Republican didrachm, though such didrachms were certainly no longer in 
circulation, and of aurei of Nerva and Divus Nerva, though Nerva&apos;s aurei were only a decade old so didn&apos;t need restriking because of wear. 
It explains why Trajan Decius&apos; restored antoniniani included coins for Divus Augustus, whose original denarii had long since disappeared 
from circulation. And finally it explains why Titus&apos; restored bronzes included coins for Galba, whose original bronzes were also only a dozen 
years old. 

As Mattingly wrote regarding Titus&apos; selection of emperors for restoration: &quot;The list of persons whose coins were to be restored was evidently 
drawn up with deliberate care. Tiberius, Claudius, and Galba were included, Caligula, Nero, Otho, and Vitellius omitted. The list is something 
like a roll of honour of the early Empire, preserving all memories that deserved to be remembered&quot; (BMC II, p. lxxviii). 

Relative to dating Trajan&apos;s restored coins, the traditional dating of AD 107 is based on Eckhel&apos;s theory linking the restitution coinage with the 
general recoinage that Dio places after Trajan&apos;s return from the Second Dacian War. Bernhard Woytek disagrees, and places their issue in AD 
112/113, surmising that the appearance of Divus Nerva in this coinage must be contemporary to his appearance on an aureus securely dated 
to that period. Clay, however, pleads for the traditional dating of recoinage which, according to Dio, began circa AD 107. Curtis states that &quot;If 
the restored coinage was connected with the recoinage, and the recoinage began circa AD 107, how likely is it that Trajan would have waited 
until AD 112-3 to issue the restored coins resulting from that recoinage?&quot;

The reverse of this aureus is strongly reminiscent of aurei of Augustus, which also featured a standing bull (RIC I 538 and 166), and as such 
might be considered an attempt by the Flavians to link their rule with that of the first emperor. It has also been proposed that the cattle on these 
coins, as well as on the coins of Augustus, are based on a sculptural group in bronze by the 5th century sculptor Myron. In 28 BC, Augustus 
brought the group from Greece and installed them in front of his Temple of Apollo on the Palatine in order to commemorate his victory over 
Antony and Cleopatra at Actium. Vespasian moved the statues to the Temple of Pax, and the bull features on his aurei and that of Titus, as in 
this example. This version, with the bull facing left, is particularly rare; only four appear in CoinArchives.

Leo Biaggi de Blasys (1906-1979) was a Swiss sugar magnate and sportsman whose fascination with ancient Rome led to the creation of one 
of the world&apos;s greatest collections of Roman gold coins. Born in Genoa to a Swiss-Italian diplomat and a French mother, he became active in 
the Red Cross after 1943 and, with his father, he repeatedly helped Jews in Italy escape persecution in the later years of World War II. He was 
also alleged to have knowingly aided in the escape of high-ranking Nazis, a notion dismissed by his friends and relations. In 1961, he received 
the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic for his services. His collection focused on Roman gold from the Republic to late Empire, ultimately 
comprising over 2,000 specimens. The gold collection was purchased en bloc by Bank Leu (Zurich) in 1978, and slowly sold off to collectors 
over the next few decades. More than 500 ex-Biaggi coins were sold by Numismatica Ars Classica in their Auction 49 in 2008. The Biaggi 
pedigree remains highly prized among collectors of Roman gold. 

Valentine John Eustance Ryan (1882-1947) was a wealthy Irish landowner who divided his time between his homeland, the United Kingdom 
and Switzerland. His early passion for coins benefited from his association with Herbert Seaby, and in 1926 he was instrumental in establishing 
B.A. Seaby Ltd. in London. A founding member of the British Numismatic Society, his interests spanned British, Scottish and ancient coins. 
His collection was sold posthumously by Glendining&apos;s 1950-1952, with the fourth sale devoted to Roman gold aurei and solidi. His coins 
consequently found their way into other important European and American collections, including Biaggi, Stack, Vermeule, Ebert, and de Wit.

At 205 miles long, and running from Brindisium to Beneventum, the Via Traiana was one of the great super highways of the Roman empire, 
replacing the Via Appia which had been built in 312 BC as the principal route between southern Italy and beyond. Despite being two miles 
longer than the Appian way, the Via Traiana was substantially less arduous to traverse and, according to Strabo, cut an entire day off the 
journey. One of a number of large municipal projects undertaken by Trajan during his rule, and paid for at the emperor&apos;s own expense, the 
construction of this super highway took place between AD 109 and 113 and was most likely undertaken by the Roman legions in what was 
a period of relative peace within the empire. As the adage goes, &quot;all roads lead to Rome&quot;, and this was no exaggeration. At the peak of the 
empire the road system stretched for more than 250,000 miles with 29 of these great highways radiating from the capital. They proved vital for 
the infrastructure of the empire, allowing for the high-speed transport of trade and communications as well as armies, officials and civilians. 
Such was the success and durability of these roads that a substantial number survived well into the modern day, with many still being used as 
the basis for modern transportation links.

Hadrian made a brief visit to Judaea circa AD 130, during his second great provincial tour of AD 129-132. Prior to his arrival, rumors spread 
among the Jews that he intended to rebuild Jerusalem and the great Temple, destroyed during the Jewish War of AD 66-73, so he was at first 
warmly welcomed. However, Hadrian decided to rebuild the city as the Roman veteran colony of Aelia Capitolina, with a temple to Jupiter 
replacing the one once dedicated to Jehovah. This ultimately sparked the bloody Bar Kokhba Revolt of AD 132-135, which devastated the 
province and darkened Hadrian&apos;s final years. The rare coinage issued to mark his visit, with the legend ADVENTVS AVG IVDAEA (&quot;the 
Emperor Enters Judaea&quot;) depicts Hadrian being greeted by a female personification of the province and two children bearing palm branches. 
Although these coins are usually dated to AD 134-138, there is no suggestion of a military conflict in the design and the province is clearly 
named Judaea, which suggest it was struck before the conflict concluded in 135. Judaea was renamed Syria Palaestina in response to the Bar 
Kochba conflict, though precisely when this occurred is not known.

Following an abortive attempt at naming an heir who predeceased him (Aelius Caesar), the aging Emperor Hadrian settled on a capable 
senator and ex consul of Gallic ancestry, T. Aurelius Fulvius Boionius Antoninus, as his intended successor. After a show of reluctance, the 
52-year old Antoninus accepted his adoption on February 25, AD 138. Hadrian also impelled the suicides of two kinsmen whom he suspected 
of having designs on the throne, causing Hadrian&apos;s popularity to sink along with his health. Antoninus quickly gathered the reins of power and, 
when Hadrian died on July 10, his accession was uncontested. However, his formal request for Hadrian&apos;s deification was soundly rejected by 
the Senate. Only by threatening to resign and plunge the empire into chaos did Antoninus force the Senate to grant his request. In grudging 
respect for his filial loyalty, the Senate granted him the title of Pius, which appears on his coinage from late AD 138. 

This aureus, which conspicuously lacks the title of Augustus, is generally assigned to the five-month period of Antoninus&apos;s Caesarship under 
Hadrian. Hill, however, places it after Hadrian&apos;s death and during Antoninus&apos;s dispute with the Senate, during which he renounced the title 
of Augustus.

After his own adoption by Hadrian in February of AD 138, Antoninus in turn adopted two other young men, Marcus Aurelius and Lucius 
Verus. It is widely assumed that Hadrian induced Antoninus to make these adoptions and thus secure the succession for another generation. 
Like Hadrian, Marcus was of an aristocratic Roman family of Spanish origin and distantly related to Trajan. Lucius was the son of Aelius 
Caesar, Hadrian&apos;s first adoptive heir, who predeceased him. After Hadrian&apos;s death, Antoninus made some adjustments in the future succession, 
giving Marcus every preferment (including his daughter&apos;s hand in marriage), while shoving Lucius into the background. This aureus, struck 
in AD 140, still puts the two imperial heirs on fairly equal terms, showing both youths accompanying Antoninus in a processional quadriga. 
Within a year, Verus disappears from the coinage, while Marcus is clearly marked out as Caesar and primary heir to the throne.

($500) 

Struck between 140-144 AD, while Marcus Aurelius was Caesar, the reverse of this coin dwells on the responsibilities of the Pontifex 
Maximus, leader of the four great Roman priesthoods and the most prominent and influential of priests within the Roman Empire. Originally a 
position chosen by popular vote, it wasn&apos;t until the reign of Augustus that the role of Pontifex Maximus was merged with the other priesthoods 
to become a position held by the reigning emperor. The two main priestly colleges were those of the Augurs and Pontificate, whose emblems 
are displayed on the reverse we see here. The sacrificial knife or secespita, used for opening the body of the sacrificial victim, the aspergillum, 
used for sprinkling either blood or water. The guttus, a sacrificial jug with a narrow neck from which liquid could be poured in drops, the 
lituus, a distinctively crooked staff used by augurs for the divination of the heavens and finally, the simpulum, a small vessel, or ladle with a 
long handle used at sacrifices to make libations or for pouring onto the head of the sacrificial victims. All of these emblems would have been 
highly symbolic, signifying the immense power the Pontifex Maximus held, as such they formed part of a commonly used motif, frequently 
employed by emperors during the early imperial period.

Dr. Athos D. Moretti (1907-1993) was the director of a major Swiss pharmaceutical company who initially collected paintings. In the 1950s, 
at the urging of his wife, he switched to coins, and in time built up significant collections of Greek silver, Roman gold and Milanese coins of 
all eras. A generous patron of art and scholarship, he made his collections widely available for study and financed the publication of several 
important references. His gold collection was bought en bloc by Numismatic Fine Arts and sold anonymously at auction between 1989 and 
1991. Very discrete during his lifetime, Moretti possessed a keen eye for quality and his collection pedigree has become highly prized since 
his passing.

On the death of Antoninus Pius in AD 161, Marcus Aurelius created Lucius Verus co-emperor with tribunician power. For the first time the 
imperial powers, except for the position of pontifix maximus, were fully shared between two persons. The reverse type of this issue, employed 
on coins of both Aurelius and Verus, commemorates the union of these two emperors and the concord that their joint rule would bring to the 
empire.

The Trau Collection was formed and maintained by three generations of an Austrian family from circa 1870 to the 1930s. Carl Trau (1811-
1887) was a chemist in Vienna who branched out into importing tea and other luxury goods from the Orient. A founding member of the 
Austrian Numismatic Society, his collecting interest focused on Medieval coinage. His son Franz Sr. (1842-1905) carried on the family 
business and refocused the numismatic collection on ancient coins, particularly Roman Imperial issues. Franz Jr. (1881-1931) oversaw the 
first Trau auction of about 2,300 coins, medals and books by Egger in January 1904 and continued to build the collection over the next two 
and half decades. The greater part of the collection was sold by Adolph Hess, with Gilhofer and Ranschburg, at two auctions in 1935 and 
1936. The Traus were quite eclectic and systematic in their collecting, acquiring Roman coins in all metals and denominations, including great 
rarities seldom offered before or since.

Annia Galeria Faustina the Younger was born in about AD 129 to Antoninus Pius and his wife, Faustina the Elder. In AD 138, the emperor 
Hadrian arranged for her betrothal to Lucius Verus, also about eight. After Antoninus inherited the throne, he broke the engagement and 
instead betrothed her to his other adoptive son, Marcus Aurelius. The couple were wed in AD 145 to great rejoicing. Faustina was named 
Augusta in AD 147, replacing her late mother. Her coinage commences that year and continues for the next three decades, showing her 
passage from a fresh-faced princess to a mature matron, and providing a pageant of Roman feminine hairstyles over that span.

The cult of Cybele, known by a variety of names including &apos;The Great Mother&apos;, was brought to Rome in the late third century BC, where 
she was worshipped in the form of a sacred stone. Her rituals were characterized most notably through ecstatic rituals where her worshippers 
became insensitive to pain and her priests castrated themselves in homage to her mythical lover Attis. Cybele&apos;s role as life-giver and sustainer 
made her especially attractive to women, and she first features on coins of the Imperial women, beginning with Diva Faustina. Cybele is often 
shown riding in a chariot pulled by lions or, as on this example, sitting on a throne flanked by lions.

The reverse records the re-installation of Gaius Julius Sohaemus as king of Armenia. Sohaemus, a member of the royal household of the 
Syrian caravan city of Emesa, was originally crowned as king by Antoninus Pius in AD 144, an event also recorded on that emperor&apos;s coins. 
In AD 161, the Parthians invaded Armenia and drove him into exile. An offensive led by Verus cleared out the Parthians and re-established 
the pro-Roman regime of Sohaemus, who is seen here receiving his crown. The exceptional artistry of the obverse portrait, together with the 
complex reverse composition, marks this as a special issue celebrating Verus&apos; feat of arms.

Hadrian, childless and without either a successor or heir, chose Lucius Ceionius Commodus as his adopted son in AD 136, and renamed him 
as Lucius Aelius Caesar. Aelius was sent to the Roman province of Pannonia to serve as governor, where he died of tuberculosis in AD 138. 
Hadrian now made his second choice for his heir, Titus Aurelius Fulvus Boionius Antoninus. Hadrian actually wanted Marcus Aurelius to 
succeed him on the throne, but realized that Aurelius was far too young, so instead he went with the highly respected Antoninus. As a condition 
of his adoption, and to ensure an orderly line of succession, Antoninus Pius adopted both his nephew, Marcus Aurelius, and Aelius Caesar&apos;s 
son, Lucius. The relatively young Lucius would change his name to Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus, but he would later drop Commodus 
and add Verus after ascending to the throne, along with his adoptive brother and co-ruler Marcus Aurelius. The present type depicts the two 
&quot;brothers&quot; and co-rulers clasping hands with an inscription noting the &quot;harmony&quot; between the two Augusti.

Immediately after Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus had been installed as joint emperors, the Parthians tested the new regime by breaking a 
long-standing peace treaty and invading the buffer state of Armenia in AD 161, ejecting its pro-Roman king. In response, Lucius led a large 
Roman expeditionary force eastward and launched a counter-offensive, ejecting the Parthians from Armenia in AD 163. This initial Roman 
victory is celebrated on the reverse of this aureus, which gives Verus the title Armeniacus.

The second of six daughters born to Marcus Aurelius and Faustina Junior, Lucilla grew up as an imperial princess, with the strange mix 
of power and helplessness such a position entailed in ancient Rome. In AD 161, at the age of 12, she was betrothed to Lucius Verus, her 
father&apos;s co-emperor, who was 18 years her senior and had many years earlier actually been betrothed to her mother. This lovely aureus was 
likely struck shortly after her marriage to Verus in AD 164, with a longer form of obverse legend identifying her as &quot;daughter of Antoninus 
Augustus&quot; (Marcus Aurelius). Later coins shorten this to simply &quot;Lucilla Augusta.&quot; Lucilla lost the title of Augusta after the sudden death of 
Verus in AD 169 and her subsequent forced marriage to the elderly senator Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus. The loss of status led her into an 
unsuccessful plot against her brother Commodus in AD 182, with fatal results for her.

This aureus was struck in AD 179, during the closing stages of the Marcomannic War, in which Commodus accompanied his father Marcus 
Aurelius to the front to ingratiate himself with Rome&apos;s soldiery. The obverse depicts the young, smooth-faced Commodus dressed for war, 
while the reverse image of a striding Mars alludes to the conflict, which had occupied much of his father&apos;s reign. Marcus Aurelius wished 
to &quot;tame&quot; the Germanic tribes and create two new Roman provinces on the far side of the Rhine-Danube frontier, a task requiring enormous 
expenditures in blood, money and manpower. The exertion led to the death of Marcus in March of the following year. His generals tried to 
convince Commodus to continue the war until his father&apos;s vision was achieved. But the young emperor had endured enough of a soldier&apos;s 
rough life, patched up a quick peace with the tribes, and returned to Rome in Autumn AD 180.

Clarence Sweet Bement (1843-1923) was a manufacturing magnate in Philadelphia, PA whose outside interests spanned minerals, books, 
and historical coins. In each of these spheres, he assembled legendary collections that either became the core of important national holdings 
(his mineral collection now resides with the American Museum of Natural History in New York) or highly sought-after pedigrees for latter-
day collectors. Bement&apos;s coin collection included United States, foreign and ancient coins; in the ancients category, they included all types 
of Greek and Roman coinage. He was a keen observer of European auctions and private dealers, and not afraid to spend what were then 
considered enormous sums to acquire coins of outstanding beauty and rarity. His ancients collection was sold in Naville VIII in June, 1924, a 
sale that became a benchmark of high-quality cataloguing for later generations.

Bruttia Crispina was the daughter of Gaius Bruttius Praesens, an influential Roman nobleman from Lucania. Her marriage to the teenaged 
Commodus was arranged in AD 178 by his father, Marcus Aurelius, to shore up support among the Roman gentry in the wake of the abortive 
rebellion of Avidius Cassius. Crispina was a legendary beauty but this probably had little effect on the egocentric Commodus, who took a 
succession of lovers of both sexes. Her inability to produce an heir led Commodus to tire of her; accordingly, she was charged with adultery 
and banished to the island of Capri in AD 188, where she was later executed. It is sometimes asserted she died much earlier in the reign, 
after the conspiracy of Lucilla in AD 182, but this is due to a faulty reading of the main sources for the era, the Historia Augusta and Cassius 
Dio. Indeed, inscriptions record her as still being empress in the late AD 180s. Her coinage is not as extensive as that of previous empresses, 
probably due to her husband&apos;s indifference. The portraiture, however, depicts a graceful young lady with a long, swan-like neck, as seen here.

From the Brexit Collection. 

The 89-day reign of Pertinax was, in many ways, a rerun of Galba&apos;s transient principate 125 years before. Like Galba, Pertinax was considered 
a distinguished elder statesman who could manage affairs after the collapse of a long-established dynasty. Like Galba, Pertinax tried to impose 
strict economy after a period of extravagance. And, when he tried to discipline the mutinous Praetorians, he met Galba&apos;s fate. 

Pertinax&apos;s gold aurei are struck from an extraordinary number of dies, given the brevity of his reign. Thirteen obverse dies and 41 reverse dies 
have been recorded, indicating an almost frenzied output of the Rome mint during this period, perhaps attempting to keep up with his promised 
payments to the Praetorians. Though uniformly of high quality, the portraits vary greatly in detail and are clearly produced by many engravers. 
The obverse die seen here shows a distinctive three-pointed beard that was later adopted by his eventual successor, Septimius Severus.

Following the death of Pertinax in AD 193, and the &quot;sale&quot; of the Roman throne by the Praetorian Guard to Didius Julianus, the legions of Syria 
hailed their governor, Pescennius Niger, as emperor. Septimius Severus, who had been proclaimed emperor by the Danubian legions at about 
the same time, first secured his power by subduing Rome, then marched to encounter Niger. In the ensuing battles, Severus proved to be the 
stronger adversary and Niger was overtaken as he attempted escape to Parthia. He was executed and his head was sent to Severus, who then 
ruthlessly slaughtered the rest of Niger&apos;s family.

This early aureus of Severus still employs the name Pertinax, which he assumed after seizing the throne in mid-AD 193. Helvius Pertinax had 
been a close friend and mentor of Severus as he rose in the Roman Senate, and he naturally hoped to do well when the elderly Pertinax became 
emperor following the murder of Commodus. But Pertinax was himself killed by the Praetorians after only 89 days, sparking Severus&apos;s own 
bid for power, during which he posed as the old man&apos;s avenger. A few years later, Severus discarded the name Pertinax after he retroactively 
adopted himself into the family of Marcus Aurelius, thus becoming the &quot;brother&quot; of Commodus, whom Pertinax had replaced.

This would appear to be the only recorded example of this aureus type, recorded in the 1985 Spanish publication of Juan R. Cayón and 
subsequently noted by Calicó in 2003, but otherwise unpublished. RIC records an example with the same obverse legend and reverse type, but 
with a draped and cuirassed bust instead of the laureate head seen here. The dated obverse inscription, the exquisite engraving of the dies, and 
the exceptionally well-centered strike would seem to mark this as a special, limited issue, perhaps explaining its extreme rarity.

The legend PACATOR ORBIS may be translated as &quot;Pacifier of the World.&quot; It is seen for the first time on a Roman coin with this issue of 
AD 207-208, accompanied by the radiate bust of Sol Invictus, whose worship within the Roman Empire began its rise to prominence in the 
reign of Severus. The cult likely was brought back by the legions of Severus after his campaigns against the Parthians circa AD 197. Solar 
worship was well established among the Persic peoples of the East, and the cult of Mithras (also associated with Sol) was already popular 
among the legions. Within a few decades the solar cult would become quasi-monotheistic and the last great rival of Christianity within the 
Roman Empire.

Septimius Severus waged his last military campaign against the Caledonians on the northern border of Britain, where he himself died at his 
campaign headquarters at York in February AD 211. Among those who accompanied him on the campaign were his wife Julia Domna, as well 
as his sons Caracalla and Geta. Septimius and Caracalla commanded this campaign, with Caracalla becoming sole commander after his father 
had fallen ill. The two often did not agree on matters of strategy and we are told that at one point that Caracalla became so enraged that he 
appeared ready to stab his father in the back before the entire army. Upon Severus&apos; death at York in February AD 211, Caracalla made peace 
with the Caledonians on less-than-favorable terms, which required the Romans retreat to the agreed border of Hadrian&apos;s Wall

trusted dealers as agents to seek out works of rarity and beauty the world over. His impressive coin collections included ancient Greek and 
Roman pieces in silver and gold, including eight of the famous Aboukir gold medallions found in Egypt in 1902, and more than 200 gold aurei,

This aureus celebrates the second Parthian campaign of Septimius Severus, circa AD 197-198. Severus raised three new Roman Legions for 
the purpose, I, II and III Parthica; he took I and III with him and left II Parthica in Italy to keep watch on Rome in his absence. Moving with 
great speed, Severus caught the Parthians unprepared. His passage to the Parthian capital of Cestiphon was nearly uncontested, and the city 
was duly attacked and plundered, yielding a vast trove of gold and gems, as well as 100,000 captives, who were sold into slavery. On January 
28 AD 198, Severus accepted the title Parthicus Maximus and raised his eldest son Antoninus, known to history by his nickname Caracalla, 
to the rank of co-Augustus.

The Roman populace would certainly have welcomed the restoration of &quot;Everlasting Peace and Security&quot; proclaimed on the reverse of this 
attractive aureus, issued by Caracalla circa AD 212. Its issue came soon after Caracalla&apos;s murder of his younger brother and co-emperor, Geta, 
and the bloody purge of his supporters, which had filled the capital with chaos and dread. Awful as these events were, they finally settled a 
horrific sibling rivalry, which had threatened to tear the Roman Empire apart, and allowed at least a semblance of order and prosperity to 
return.

Born in March, AD 189 to Severus and his wife Julia Domna, Publius Septimius Geta was only 11 months younger than his brother and was 
said to closely resemble his father&apos;s coloring and temperament. After Caracalla was named co-Augustus with his father in A.D. 198, Geta was 
made Caesar, or junior emperor, unintentionally highlighting his second-class status within the dynastic hierarchy. This perhaps contributed to 
an intense sibling rivalry between Geta and Caracalla, which, after the boys reached their teens, threatened to tear the family and indeed the 
empire apart. Despite dynastic propaganda, which portrayed a close-knit ruling family, including this rare aureus depicting the young Geta 
with his parents, each brother cultivated a circle of friends and sycophants, which quickly turned into armed gangs that frequently clashed in 
the streets of Rome.

This reverse type depicting Severus Alexander as Romulus can be seen to have both past and future iconographic significance when it was 
struck circa AD 230. Since he was required to conduct campaigns against both the Sassanians and Germanic tribes for the well-being of the 
empire, a likening to Romulus is obvious. As the 1,000th anniversary of the founding of the city lay only 17 years away, however, a similar 
reference to Rome&apos;s legendary founder also seems appropriate.

In sharp contrast to his predecessor, Severus Alexander embraced the traditional Roman pantheon of deities and celebrated them on his 
coinage. He chose Jupiter as defender (Propugnator) of the regime, as exemplified on this attractive gold aureus. This was certainly a 
deliberate policy to distance himself from his cousin, whose close attachment to the Emesan solar deity Elagabalus (by which name later 
generations called the young emperor) alienated the Roman populace and army.

If nothing else, the high quality of portraiture seen on coins of the ephemeral emperors Gordian I, Gordian II, Balbinus and Pupienus, none 
of whom reigned more than three months, points to the remarkable adaptability of the Roman mint during this tumultuous period. During 
the year AD 238, die engravers created effigies for no fewer than seven different rulers (Maximinus I, Maximus, the two Gordians, Balbinus, 
Pupienus, and Gordian III) in rapid succession, yet each portrait is distinctive and, from the evidence of surviving portrait busts, surprisingly 
true to the unique physiognomy of each emperor. 

An Offering of Gordian III Aurei 

Gordian III&apos;s six year reign was an island of relative tranquility in the turbulent mid-third century AD. This and the following seven coins, all 
with different reverse types, represent a remarkable representative offering of gold aurei from this transitional reign. 

Gordian was the grandson of Gordian I Africanus, patriarch of an immensely wealthy and influential family, who in AD 238 was proclaimed 
emperor in revolt against the cruel Maximinus I Thrax. The regime collapsed almost immediately, and, through an improbable series of events, 
the 13-year-old Gordian III was eventually saluted as emperor, the only one of AD 238&apos;s six Roman rulers to survive the year. Due to his youth, 
he was at first dominated by his mother and a board of senators, who had to walk a tightrope to avoid the fate of previous short-lived regimes. 
In AD 241, Gordian appointed as Praetorian Prefect the capable Timesitheus, whose daughter Tranquillina became his bride. Timesitheus 
became a beneficent mentor who kept Gordian&apos;s weak government on an even keel. But in the same year, the Sasanian Persians under Shapur 
I crossed Rome&apos;s desert frontier and threatened Antioch, forcing young Gordian to take up arms. His army engaged Shapur at Rhesaena in 
Syria in won a signal victory early in AD 243. But the death of Timesitheus that winter brought Roman progress to a grinding halt. Supplies 
dwindled, and the new prefect, Philip, blamed the shortage on Gordian&apos;s incompetence. The soldiers grew rebellious. Gordian reportedly 
offered to abdicate in Philip&apos;s favor, but Philip instead simply seized the throne and had Gordian quietly murdered early in AD 244. Sadly, his 
youth and gentle nature had proven unsuited to the demands of hard times.

The model for this reverse type is the famed marble Farnese Hercules statue that was discovered in the excavations of the Baths of Caracalla 
in 1546. It stood for over 200 years in the Palazzo Farnese in Rome, from whence it gained its name, and was moved to Naples in 1787, where 
it is now displayed in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale. The statue is thought to be an enlarged copy sculpted in the early 3rd century AD 
by Glycon based on an original by Lysippus dating to the 4th century BC. The statue depicts Hercules at rest after completing his Labors: 
he is shown standing with his club, draped in the skin of the Nemean Lion, set upright on a rock, propped under his left arm supporting the 
weight of his muscular frame, his head slightly nodding forward in a weary attitude, and he holds the apples of the Hesperides behind his back 
in his right hand. The sculpture was apparently well-liked by the Romans, and copies have been found in Roman palaces and gymnasiums.

From the Brexit Collection. 

Born in AD 237, Marcus Julius Severus Philippus was seven years old when his eponymous father, the emperor Philip I, had him proclaimed 
Caesar early in AD 244. Philip I thus hoped to form something the Roman Empire had lacked since the Severan era: a stable dynasty. This 
aureus was struck shortly thereafter, showing the young Caesar as &quot;Prince of Youth&quot; on the reverse. Due to the increasing shortage of precious 
metals during the reign, aurei of both Philips are quite rare. Such shortages forced the regime to be parsimonious in its handouts to soldiers, 
meaning their loyalties were always highly suspect. This ultimately led to the downfall of the dynasty less than five years after its inception.

The reverse of this impressive aureus refers to &quot;Peace Everywhere&quot; (VBIQVE PAX), which Probus had seemingly achieved in AD 281 after 
years of relentless campaigning. In that year he celebrated a well-deserved triumph in Rome, where this piece was struck. The relative calm 
reportedly prompted Probus to express hope for such a universal peace that his armies could be disbanded. Word of this remark got back to his 
soldiers, who were being employed in land reclamation and other public works to keep them from being idle. Early in AD 282, while Probus 
was en route to the Danube frontier, a rebellion broke out among the disgruntled legionaries that rapidly spread through the ranks. The emperor 
was trapped in a guard tower near Sirmium and butchered by his own soldiers. So dangerous were the times that even an emperor as successful 
as Probus could not escape an undeserved death.

Carinus is either one of Rome&apos;s most depraved emperors, or one of its most unfairly maligned. The view of him as a despoiler of women and 
corrupter of youth likely stems from the effective propaganda of his successor, Diocletian. In reality, Carinus would seem to have had little 
time in his brief reign to engage in the kind of debauchery assigned to him by the notoriously unreliable Historia Augusta. The evidence 
provided by his coinage depicts him as a typical military man of the age, always en route to, engaging in, or celebrating victory in battle. This 
rare aureus depicts Carinus in a fully military pose, holding a shield and spear as if to confront Rome&apos;s enemies head-on. The reverse shows 
Mars, god of war, on the march with shield and spear, probably reflecting Carinus&apos;s departure for the Gallic frontier in mid AD 282.

Diocletian (284-305 AD) was one of the most important reformers in the history of the Roman Empire. Following decades of transition, as 
well as significant political and economic upheaval during the middle part of the third century, Diocletian set about stabilizing the Empire. His 
solution was to form a diarchy, with himself taking control of the eastern Empire while his colleague Maximian (286-305 AD) took control of 
the west. After several years, Diocletian saw the need to expand this arrangement further and in AD 293 the diarchy became a tetrarchy. Each 
senior Augustus took a junior Caesar to assist with matters in their respective half of the Empire: a senior and junior colleague in the West 
(Maximian and Constantius Chlorus), and a senior and junior colleague in the East (Diocletian and Galerius). Four tetrarchic capital cities 
of the Roman Empire were established to help ensure further administrative stability: Nicomedia (the seat of Diocletian) and Sirmium (the 
seat of Galerius) in the east, and Mediolanum (the seat of Maximian) and Augustus Treverorum (the seat of Constantius Chlorus) in the west. 
Diocletian&apos;s new system also ensured a smoother process for the succession than had been seen earlier in the third century and, when he and 
Maximian retired in AD 305, Galerius and Constantius were raised to the senior rank of Augustus and each took new junior Caesars: Severus 
II in the West, and Maximinus in the East. The tetrarchy proved to be a strong arrangement, providing the immediate stability that the Empire 
needed; it lasted until around AD 313 when Constantine took control of the West and Licinius the East.

During the reigns immediately prior to Diocletian, the weight of the gold aureus fluctuated wildly, from as heavy as 6.90 grams to as light 
as 4 grams, and seemed to vary almost arbitrarily from mint to mint. This irregularity continued into the first years of the new regime (see 
previous lot), but between AD 286 and 290, Diocletian stabilized the aureus at 60 to the pound, or about 5.46 grams of gold, throughout the 
Roman Empire. This aureus, struck about a year later and almost 20 percent heavier than the previous lot from the same mint of Cyzicus, 
bears evidence of this early reform. This set the stage for his complete revamping of the Roman monetary system, which commenced with the 
introduction of two new denominations, the silver argenteus and the billon follis, circa AD 293.

Like Diocletian, Maximian rose through the ranks of the Roman Army during the war-torn later third century. Once Diocletian was installed as 
emperor, he soon offered to share power with his old friend, whom he trusted implicitly. Though less of a thinker than Diocletian, Maximian 
was a better soldier, a fact Diocletian understood and even appreciated. Maximian thus became Hercules to Diocletian&apos;s Jupiter, the man of 
action following the lead of a great planner and organizer. The partnership worked remarkably well, and in AD 293 the diarchy was expanded 
to a Tetrarchy with the addition of two subordinate rulers. Imperial portraiture during the early years of the joint reign, particularly at western 
mints, could achieve a semblance of the realism and individuality seen in previous generations, as exemplified by this handsome aureus 
portrait of Maximian. Within a few years, such representations were replaced by a hard &quot;generic&quot; look that stressed the uniformity of the four 
rulers making up the unique regime.

Flavius Valerius Constantius was a native of Naissus in modern Serbia, scene of a great Roman victory over the Goths in AD 268. Like many 
later emperors, he found escape from his low social standing in the Roman army and rose steadily through the ranks. Along the way, he took 
a local barmaid named Helena as his common-law wife and she bore him a son, Constantine, in AD 273 or 274. By AD 284, Constantius had 
risen to become military governor of Dalmatia. He supported Diocletian&apos;s bid for power and was rewarded with a series of important posts 
in the new regime. In March of AD 293, Diocletian and Maximianus appointed him Caesar of the West. He chose as his capital the fortress 
city of Treveri, modern Trier in western Germany, where this remarkable gold aureus was struck. The local mint possessed at least one die 
engraver of exceptional talent, who continued to produce gold coins with high quality portraiture, typically in high relief on compact flans as 
seen here, well into the reign of Constantine I. 

This coin gives every evidence of coming from the famous Arras-Beaurains Hoard of 1922, which contained between 200 and 300 gold coins, 
and at least 40 huge medallions, of the Tetrarchy and early Constantinian era. It is not published in the 1977 corpus of the hoard by Pierre 
Bastien, although 23 other aurei of the exact same type are recorded, many with similar distinctive toning. However, the hoard was dispersed 
immediately after its discovery and reconstructing it, in the words of B.A. Baldwin, &quot;will for ever be impossible in an exact sense.&quot;

This aureus was struck at Siscia (modern Sisak, Croatia) during the brief border war of AD 316 between the rival emperors Licinius, in the 
East, and Constantine I, in the West. The reverse invokes the protection of Jupiter, traditional head of the Roman pantheon, for his champion 
Licinius in his struggle against Constantine, who had forsaken the old gods of Rome to embrace Christianity. The subtle use of the singular 
ending AVG, instead of the plural AVGG, on the reverse indicates Licinius invokes Jupiter&apos;s aid for himself and not his erstwhile colleague.

Proof that history does repeat itself can be found in the sad tale of Martinian, a puppet ruler installed by the Eastern Roman Emperor Licinius 
in the midst of his second civil war against Constantine I &quot;the Great.&quot; Martinian was of obscure origins, but by the mid AD 320s he had risen 
to become the chief minister of Licinius, just as it became apparent that a final clash with Constantine was imminent. Though Licinius had 
a bigger army, Constantine was much the better general and inflicted a heavy defeat on his rival in Thrace on July 3, AD 324. Crossing to 
Chalcedon, Licinius declared Constantine deposed and raised Martinian to the office of Augustus, with instructions to prevent Constantine 
from crossing into Asia Minor. Constantine easily evaded Martinian&apos;s blocking force, landed in Asia and cornered Licinius at Nicomedia. 
Having no choice, Licinius surrendered on terms brokered by his wife (and Constantine&apos;s sister) Constantia. Martinian went into exile in 
Cappadocia, but was executed a few months later when Licinius was detected plotting a return to power. Seven years before, under virtually 
identical circumstances, Licinius had appointed Valerius Valens to a similar role, with almost identical results. 

Like those of Valerius Valens, coins of Martinian are quite rare and limited to a single issue from the mint of Nicomedia. Surviving examples 
tend to be heavily worn or damaged, but this specimen is in an exceptional state of preservation. The reverse evokes &quot;Jupiter the Protector,&quot; 
Licinius&apos; patron deity, who notably failed to protect him and Martinian from the wrath of Constantine and his Christian god.

The dating on this issue, which for the first time depicts Francia, personification of the Franks, is an open question. The authors of RIC VI

Constantine I &quot;the Great&quot; imposed radical and important reforms to all parts of the Roman currency system during his reign, one of the most 
significant of these being his replacement of the gold aureus with the lighter gold soldius, a new gold denomination, weighing approximately 
4.50 grams, that would survive well into late Antiquity. While, in the East, the aureus continued to be struck by Maximinus II and Licinius into 
the 320s, the production of the solidus began early in Constantine&apos;s reign in the West of the Empire. The fractional denominations of the new 
solidus were the gold semissis (half solidus), and the gold 9-siliqua (or 1½ scripulum) piece, which would later be discarded in favour of the 
tremissis (one-third solidus). Constantine also abandoned Diocletian&apos;s silver argenteus, and toward the end of the 320s introduced the lighter 
silver siliqua (although it might have continued to be called the argenteus by contemporaries), as well as the heavier silver miliarensis. The 
miliarensis weighed the same as a solidus, but was worth 1/18th of the gold coin, whereas a silver siliqua was worth ¾ of the miliarensis. Both 
of these silver denominations also proved to have longevity, continuing to be used well into the early Byzantine period. The billon coinage 
steadily decreased in size and weight throughout Constantine&apos;s reign, and he finally abandoned the follis as a denomination in around AD 
318/9. With Licinius&apos;s defeat in the East in AD 324, the mints there came under Constantine&apos;s control, meaning that his new coinage would 
finally be produced uniformly throughout the Empire.

following day, the deeply split leadership of the Roman army met to select a new emperor, settling on Jovian as a compromise choice. He 
wasted little time in signing a humiliating peace treaty with the Persians, handing over to them most of Roman Mesopotamia, even though the 
Romans had won every major engagement in the war. Returning to Antioch, Jovian tried to paint the debacle as a Roman victory, but few were 
fooled. His coins clearly indicate Christianity&apos;s return to official favor. After a brief stay in Antioch, Jovian set out for Constantinople early in 
AD 364, stopping at Dadastana in Bithynia for a banquet. The following morning, February 17, he was found dead in his bedroom, apparently 
the victim of poisonous fumes from a smoking brazier. 

This attractive gold solidus was struck at the Balkan mint of Sirmium, not far from Jovian&apos;s birthplace. The reverse, stressing the &quot;Security of 
the Republic,&quot; mendaciously depicts a Persian captive bound at the emperor&apos;s feet.

Procopius was the last member of the house of Constantine to don the diadem. A maternal cousin of Julian II, Procopius had a successful career 
as a civil servant and was made a comes, or count, after Julian won the throne in AD 361. When Julian prepared his invasion of Persia a year 
later, he placed Procopius in command of a 30,000-man force intended to hook up with the allied Armenian army and join Julian&apos;s legions in 
Mesopotamia. Procopius later claimed that his cousin also gave him a purple cloak, along with instructions to take over as emperor should 
Julian be killed in battle. At any event, Procopius failed miserably in his role, contributing to the defeat of Julian&apos;s main force and his death 
in battle on June 27, AD 363. When the army chose Jovian as emperor, Procopius made no protest and took Julian&apos;s body back to Tarsus for 
burial. But when Jovian abruptly died a few months later and the brothers Valentinian I and Valens took over, Procopius decided to make a 
try for the throne. While Valens was away from the capital, Procopius re-emerged at Constantinople on September 28, AD 365, wrapped in 
Julian&apos;s purple cloak. The garrison proclaimed him emperor, and Procopius quickly established control of western Asia Minor. But he showed 
little strategic sense and soon some of his best officers and soldiers began defecting back to Valens. Meanwhile, Valens built his own forces 
and maneuvered Procopius into a decisive battle at Nicolea, Phrygia in May of 366. Procopius suffered a crushing defeat and was summarily 
executed in the aftermath, ending his eight-month usurpation. 

The gold coinage of Procopius carries on the Constantinian tradition of fine portraiture and crisp execution. The exceptional portrait on this 
issue shows him wearing a close beard, probably a symbol of sympathy and mourning for his kinsman Julian II. His beard and the lack of 
any Christian symbolism on the reverse also hint at possible Pagan sympathies. The solidi of Procopius are particularly rare, with only 14 
examples sold at auction since 1996.

From the Ealing Collection. Ex Spink Numismatic Circular CXI.1 (February 2003), no. RM1276. Reportedly found near the Ridgeway 
Compton, Berkshire. 

The fifth known specimen, the other four being: the British Museum (North Mendip Hoard); the Ashmolean (ex Sir Arthur Evans, cf. NC 
1915, p. 473, also North Mendip Hoard, one third broken and missing); Vienna (ex Herzfelder Collection); and Spink (bought February 1992). 

Arguing that these anonymous issues were struck between AD 367 and AD 394 and that the numerals on the reverse of these anonymous 
issues -the XV on this coin and other examples of the same type, as well a similar contemporary issue with the X -may refer to specific vota, 
Bland suggested two more specific late-fourth-century struck dates for these coins, as well as a possible occasion for their issue. As for the 
date, Bland noted that only twice during the late fourth century did a contemporary decennalia and a quindecennalia exist: for Theodosius I 
and Valentinian I in AD 388/9, or for Arcadius and Theodosius I in AD 392/3 (which he seemed to prefer). 

Since these coins were struck at two mints only -Trier and Aquileia -Bland noted the three-month interregnum following the suicide of 
Valentinian II in May 392 and before his magister militum, Arbogast, appointed the &quot;usurper&quot; Eugenius as a possibility. Arbogast disliked 
Theodosius, and would not have struck any issue in honor of that emperor, as Bland rightly noted. He suggested that a more plausible occasion 
for this issue was Theodosius&apos; victory over Arbogast and Eugenius at the Battle of the Frigidus in early September AD 394, since Aquileia was 
within the vicinity of the battlefield, and Trier, the imperial capital of the Diocese of Gaul, and one of Eugenius&apos; main mints.

The early to mid fifth century AD witnessed both halves of the Roman Empire under the control of powerful women. In the West this was 
Gallia Placidia, mother of Valentinian III. Her counterpart in the East was the formidable Aelia Pulcheria, depicted on this gold solidus. Born 
circa AD 398 to Arcadius and Aelia Eudoxia, she had a far more forceful personality than her timid younger brother, Theodosius II, who was 
left in nominal charge of the East at age 7 in AD 408. In AD 414, the Senate declared her Augusta, or Empress, whereupon she dismissed the 
courtiers who had been controlling the government and took over the regency herself. She declared her intent to remain a virgin, possibly 
to avoid a political marriage, and devoted herself to church and state. Her coinage, extensive for an empress of this era, depicts her being 
crowned by the hand of God reaching down from above. When Theodosius was killed in a riding accident in AD 450, Pulcheria briefly ruled 
as sole empress before bowing to demands that she marry and thus select a suitable man to rule as Augustus. She wisely chose the lowborn but 
capable Marcian. Pulcheria died in AD 453, having kept her vows of virginity and defense of her dynasty for a half-century.

Traditionally, the reign of Flavius Odovacar (AD 476-493) has been seen as the end of the Western Roman Empire and the beginning of the 
Middle Ages in the West. A member of the foederati -allied Germanic tribes who served in the Roman army in return for land -Odovacar was 
appointed their leader in Italy in AD 475 by the magister militum Orestes, who promised in return a third of the Italian peninsula if Odovacar 
and his Germans would assist Orestes&apos; revolt against the western emperor, Julius Nepos. Following the defeat of Nepos, Orestes elevated 
his son, Romulus, to the rank of Augustus, and immediately set about revoking his earlier arrangement with the foederati. Now, Odovacar 
revolted against Orestes, who was defeated, captured, and executed. Subsequently, Odovacar was proclaimed rex Italiae and, on 4 September 
AD 476, he compelled the young Romulus to abdicate, sending the imperial insignia to Constantinople, and thus ending Roman imperial rule 
in the West. During his reign, he provided his foederati with lands in Italy and made them beneficiaries of a special tax. He retained the Roman 
administration, senate, legal institutions, and tax system -all of which gained him the support of the senate and people. This popularity, along 
with Odovacar&apos;s military successes against the Vandals and his alliances with the Visigoths and Franks, prompted Zeno, the Roman emperor in 
the East, to remove Odovacar from power. In AD 488, Zeno called on the Ostrogothic king, Theoderic, to overthrow Odovacar. Over the next 
five years, Theoderic slowly pushed Odovacar back to the old Roman capital at Ravenna where, after a protracted siege, in AD 493, Odovacar 
surrendered. Under the terms of the peace, Theoderic and Odovacer would share the rule of Italy. At the banquet arranged to celebrate this 
treaty, however, Theoderic killed Odovacar with his own hands.

Ravenna, the fifth century capital of the Western Roman Empire, passed under the control of Odovacer in AD 476 and was captured by 
Theodoric the Ostrogoth a decade later, becoming the capital of the Ostrogothic Kingdom. During the Gothic Wars, Justinian I&apos;s great 
general Belisarius recaptured the city for the Empire in AD 540, employing the ruse that he accepted a Gothic invitation to have himself 
proclaimed Emperor of the West. Once occupying the city, Belisarius renounced all claim to the title and handed Ravenna over to Justinian, 
who commenced striking coins in his name at the city&apos;s long-established mint. Ravenna remained the Byzantine capital of Italy until it finally

The Kingdom of Axum was the only sub-Saharan African state to issue its own independent coinage in ancient times. Despite flourishing for 
about 350 years, so little is known about this kingdom that it is not possible to date most of the kings with any accuracy. It is only through the 
unstinting efforts of a handful of scholars who have been studying the civilization and its coinage over the last few decades that an order for 
their respective reigns has now been tentatively arrived at. Indeed, the only evidence we have for the existence of many of the kings is their 
coinage. Aksum is particularly noteworthy for being only the second state (Armenia was the first) to make Christianity its official faith, and 
was almost certainly the first to feature the Christian cross on its coins. It also introduces a totally novel feature to its coinage -gilding, hand 
applied, in the central portions of features of some of the silver and bronze issues.

inventory, c. 1964-1988; Arthur B. Coole Collection (1900-1978). 

Bruce W. Smith, who cataloged this piece and others in its 2011 auction appearance, provided the following pedigree information to the 
E-Sylum (Volume 14, Number 18, 1 May 2011): 

&quot;The well-known collector of Chinese coins, Arthur B. Coole (1900-1978), sold his collection of Chinese coins and paper money to Kansas 
City coin dealer Jack Klausen in 1964. In the fall of 1963 he prepared an inventory of the collection, and published about 15 copies for 
Klausen and various friends. Coole asked Klausen to agree not to break up the collection --that is, if Klausen sold it he should sell it intact. 
Klausen agreed and hoped to sell the collection to a museum. He was unable to do so, and during 1977-1978 sold the collection to Taiwan 
coin dealer, J. S. Lee. 

Years later it turned out that Lee did not buy all of the collection. There were some parts on which apparently they could not agree on a price. 
In 1988 Klausen consigned the coin trees, coin molds, and paper money printing blocks and seals to a Taisei sale, but they did not sell (despite 
published prices realized for those lots). I believe he consigned them to a different sale in the early 1990&apos;s (perhaps Pacific Coast Auctions). 
Whether they sold at that time or not is unclear, but the material was donated to a museum in Texas, either by the 1990&apos;s buyer or by Klausen&apos;s 
estate after his death in 2006.&quot;

In the early 1840s, failed civil service candidate Hong Xiuquan read a religous pamphlet given to him by a Protestant missionary. He came 
to the realization that he was, in fact, Jesus Christ&apos;s Chinese brother, sent by God to rid the nation of the Manchus. Hong studied the Bible, 
blending it with elements of Daoism and Confucianism, developing his own sect called the God Worshipping Society. By 1851 the Society 
was in open rebellion against the Manchu Qīng dynasty. Hong declared a new dynasty, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, and took for himself 
the title Heavenly King. The Taipings would successfully resist the central government for over thirteen years, at times even capturing the 
Qīng capital at Běijīng. The Taiping Rebellion would result in an estimated 20-70 million casualties, making it one of the bloodiest conflicts 
in world history.

The striking of a mere 800 silver dollars for the Sierra Leone Company was, as David Vice relates, Matthew Boulton&apos;s &apos;first undertaking in 
the field of coining precious metals. The sole reason for the Soho Mint accepting such a small and unprofitable order was to gain experience 
in this sphere of operations. Copious notes were made of the costs incurred and the lessons gleaned for striking the Company dollar. This 
information proved invaluable in later years.&apos; Very few examples of this issue have survived in high grade.

Friedrich the Wise was the first ruler of modern Saxony. He founded the University of Wittenburg in 1502, and in 1508 he appointed Martin 
Luther to a professorship in Philosophy. Later on, Friedrich was instrumental in protecting Luther from the wrath of the Church by refusing 
to enforce the Papal bull, which required Luther&apos;s writings be burned and the reformer be sent to Rome. When, in 1521, Luther was placed 
under the imperial ban by the diet at Worms, Friedrich had him brought to his castle for protection.

The lighthouse, called the Fanale dei Pisani, was originally built by the inhabitants of nearby Pisa in 1303 upon a rock emerging from the 
sea. Comprised of two main embattled cylindrical constructs, the tower&apos;s distinct shape is clearly represented here. The great-grandfather of 
Cosimo III, Grand Duke Ferdinando I de&apos; Medici, ordered the construction of warehouses in the tower&apos;s basement in 1584, expanding its use. 
The original edifice, however, was destroyed near the end of World War II in 1944 by German troops. Following the war, a new Fanale was 
built, according to the plans of its predecessor and using even material recovered from the rubble.

Selections from the RAJ Collection of Medals 

A number of simultaneous conflicts occurred during the early eighteenth century in Europe as various nation-states vied with one another 
for control of territories and right-of-ways. Some of these conflicts were part of a long-standing period of expansion, as was the case with 
the Ottoman Empire&apos;s push into Europe, while others, most notably, the war between Sweden and Russia, were between expanding states 
bumping up against each other. CNG is pleased to present a selection of medals from the RAJ Collection covering this tumultuous period, 
when grand alliances shifted back-and-forth, and grand coalitions sided on opposite ends of the battlefield. Among this selection, the medals 
associated with the Great Northern War (1700-1721) are especially interesting, since this conflict pitted the Swedish Empire against Tsarist 
Russia, for supremacy in northern, central, and eastern Europe. 

The Treaty of Passarowitz (Požarevac), signed on 21 July 1718 between the Ottoman Empire and the allied forces of Austria and the Venetian 
Republic, resulted in the loss of Venetian influence in the Peloponnesus and the Aegean, and in the restoration of Austrian control over those 
sections of Serbia that they had lost to the Ottomans during the Great Turkish War (1683-1699). This control, however, did not last long, since 
the Ottomans regained these Austrian-held territories as a result of the Treaty of Belgrade in 1739.

Concluded on 7 March 1714 in the Baden city of Rastatt, this treaty brought an end to the conflict between France and Austria during the larger 
and multi-fronted War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714). Sparked by the death of the childless Carlos II of Spain, this conflict sought to 
check once more the expansionist policies of Louis XIV, which had created much of the European warfare of the later seventeenth century.

The Great Northern War (1700-1721) 

The Great Northern War, fought between Swedish Empire (and its allies) and the Tsardom of Russia (and its allies) for supremacy in northern, 
central, and eastern Europe and especially, the Baltic. The alliances of each side were complex, and demonstrate the increasing concerns 
about the rise of Russia in European affairs. Over the course of the war, alliances shifted. One of the most notable, was Great Britain, which 
was allied first with Sweden, then Russia, then back to Sweden. Prior to the reign of Petr I Alexeyevich Velikiy (Peter the Great), Russia had 
limited interest in dealing with Europe. Under the new tsar, who had traveled to the Dutch Republic incognito to learn the art of ship building, 
this changed. His construction of the new capital at St. Petersburg was designed to provide access to the Baltic and a sea route west. Hoping 
to check Sweden, which had become a regional power following the Thirty Years&apos; War (1618-1648) and was now being ruled by the Karl XII 
(1697-1718), Russia, along with its allies -Denmark-Norway and Saxony-Poland-Lithuania -decided to attack first. Karl, however proved 
to be a capable leader and, by 1706, had thoroughly defeated his enemies. With Russia being his only remaining threat, Karl decided to 
march on Moscow. Although this maneuver met with initial success -the Battle of Holowczyn (1708) was a rounding Swedish victory -the 
tide of battle turned and he and his forces suffered a devastating defeat at the Battle of Poltava (1709). Following surrender at Perevolochna 
after Poltava, when the Swedish army was annihilated, Karl fled to exile, where he remained until 1714, for several of those years under 
house arrest, due to his scheming. During this period, Russia and Poland regained and expanded the borders they had lost, including the 
Russian occupation of Finland. Sweden&apos;s former allies, such as Great Britain and Prussia, either defected or took advantage of the king&apos;s 
absence to attack Sweden&apos;s external holdings. Upon his return from exile, Karl found Sweden facing a defensive war. His plan was to invade 
Norway to attack the Danish-controlled towns there. This move proved unsuccessful due to the Swedish lack of heavy artillery, and costly, 
because, during the siege of Fredriksten in 1718, Karl was killed by a bullet to the head. Following his death, Sweden unsuccessfully tried 
to continue the war. As a result, the Russian fleet conducted actions against the civilian population on Sweden&apos;s eastern coast. Known as the 
Rysshärjningarna (Russian Pillage of 1719-1721), such encounters as these continued until the Treaty of Nystad in 1721, formally ending the 
Great Northern War.

UNITED STATES COINAGE 

Iconic Trio of 1907 St. Gaudens Double Eagles 

1006. 
1907 St. Gaudens High Relief Wire Rim Double Eagle -$20. NGC MS 62. (642344-001). Truly a lovely coin 
with incredibly clean surfaces that seem to merit a much higher grade than the holder indicates. Struck in high relief and 
simply gorgeous! 
($10,000) 

1007. 
1907 St. Gaudens High Relief Flat Rim Double Eagle -$20. NGC MS 64. (416640-001). Another example of the 
high relief design with surfaces that would indicate a higher grade is warranted. An extremely clean coin that is most attractive 
in hand and worthy of a strong bid. 
($20,000) 

1008. 
1907 St. Gaudens Double Eagle -$20. PCGS MS 65. (3545974). The final design for the 1907 issues with the 
lower relief, which would become the standard for succeeding issues. A touch of orange highlights the devices on this coin, 
making it most attractive to view in hand. 
($2000) 

60 to 80 Known! 

1009. 
1858 San Francisco Coronet Eagle -$10. NGC AU 58. (1744539-003). NGC &quot;Top Pop&quot; -one of 11 at this grade 
at NGC. One of the great dates in the $10 Liberty head series is the 1858-S. There are reportedly 60 to 80 known examples in 
all grades. Neither NGC nor PCGS have graded a single coin in mint state. The PCGS price guide stops at AU-55. This AU58 
example is clearly among the finest surviving examples for the issue.

Stunning 1907 Wire Rim Indian Eagle 

1010. 
1907 Indian Head Wire Rim Eagle -$10. NGC MS 65. (448401-002). A lovely coin with matte surfaces that are 
almost perfectly uniform. This coin is two hidden obverse bag marks from perfection. The fields are virtually mark free. A 
wonderful coin in hand! 
($50,000) 

Key Date 1911-D Half Eagle 

1011. 
1911 Denver mint Indian Head Half Eagle -$5. NGC MS 61. (1802691-012). A nice mate to the following 
quarter eagle, this coin exhibits minor surface marks mostly limited to the obverse fields, leaving the design largely intact and 
unaffected. The key coin in the set! 
($7500) 

Key Date 1911-D Indian Head Quarter Eagle 

1012. 
1911 Denver mint Indian Head Quarter Eagle -$2½. NGC MS 64. (952620-001). Without a doubt the key to 
completing any Indian Head quarter eagle set is the 1911-D. The coin hits a wall at the MS 64 grade level. Anything above 
climbs quickly in price while the grades below are consistently near the price for the MS 64. We think this coin is solid for the 
grade and worthy of an attempt either at upgrade or a CAC sticker. 
($10,000)

1908 Philadelphia mint Indian Head Quarter Eagle -$2½. VF, enameled. High quality enameling. ($300)

1795 Two Leaves 

1014. 
1795 Flowing Hair Dollar. PCGS XF40. (50150984). BB 21; B 1. A beautiful example of the flowing hair two 
leaves 1795 dollar. Extremely clean surfaces are found on both sides of this coin with just light golden peripheral toning. A 
very attractive coin in hand. 
($10,000) 

Pair of 1797 Draped Bust Dollars -Stars 9x7, Large Letters 

1015. 
1797 Draped Bust Dollar. PCGS XF40. (29896342). BB 73; B 1. A nice clean example of the Bust, 9x7 stars small 
eagle reverse dollar. This coin has beautiful gray and blue toning on the obverse and a blend of gray, gold, and blue toning on 
the reverse. Quite clean and free of major marks. Solid for the grade. 
($10,000) 

1016. 
1797 Draped Bust Dollar. NGC VF 35. (4191391-003). BB 73; B 1. A solid coin for the grade with a blend of gold, 
orange, and blue patina mixed throughout both obverse and reverse. 
($5000) 


257 

1017. 
1799 Draped Bust Dollar. VF, light hairlines, minor marks. BB 158; B 16. 
($1000) 

1018. 
1800 Draped Bust Dollar. PCGS AU50. (28772057). BB 196; B 17. A nice clean example of the Bolender 17 
variety of this Bust dollar. The obverse has light golden toning while the reverse has peripheral ice blue toning. Both sides are 
virtually free of any distracting marks. A pretty coin in hand. 
($7500) 

1019. 
1803 Draped Bust Dollar. NGC XF 40. (3333318-002). BB 255; B 6. . Wonderful iridescent toning and some 
remaining luster are seen on this early US Bust dollar. Only the smallest of scattered marks can be found suggesting the grade 
on this coin is a match between market and true grade. A lovely coin that would make a nice addition to an early dollar set or 
US type set. 
($5000) 


258 

Key Date in the Series 

1020. 
1872 Carson City Seated Liberty Dollar. NGC AU 55. (2831236-001). One of the truly rare coins in the Seated 
Liberty dollar series. Beautiful toning with only the slightest touch of wear. Two small obverse marks prevent this coin from 
reaching a higher grade. It can be argued the quality of this coin in hand equals or exceeds many certified MS 63 examples. 
Certainly worth a strong bid. From an European collection type set and fresh to the U.S. market! 
($5000)

Found Yapham, East Riding, Yorkshire 2018. 

For over 150 years, only a single, chipped specimen of this extremely rare coinage was known. Found in Richmond, Yorkshire in 1832, the 
legend was initially read as EDIIHALD, and correctly given to AEthelwald Moll. Grantley (&quot;On a unique Styca of Alchred of Northumbria and 
Archbishop Ecgberht,&quot; in NC [1893]) interpreted it as an issue of Alchred, assuming that the final two letters were retrograde AL, a view which 
predominated until Stewart (&quot;A Northumbrian Coin of King Ethelwald and Archbishop Ecgberht,&quot; NC [1991]) returned again to the original 
reading, arguing that the whole legend should be read retrograde and outwards. Since then, three further specimens have been discovered, 
confirming the reading by Stewart. The attribution to AEthelwald Moll is no longer in doubt (See James Booth, &quot;Notes on the Keith Chapman 
Collection of Northumbrian Silver Sceattas: c. 700-c. 788,&quot; in: T. Abramson, ed., Studies in Early Medieval Coinage 2 [London, 2011], p.

Ex Maj.-Gen. A. Lyons Collection (&apos;Property of a Genlteman,&apos; Spink 219, 24 September 2013), lot 67, purchased from Mike R. Vosper, 
November 2004. 

Believed to have come from a family of landholders in Middlesex, Wulfred&apos;s name first appears as a member of Aethelheard&apos;s staff on 
historical records in 803. He later became Archdeacon of Canterbury before succeeding Archbishop Aethelheard in 805. Evidently of high 
status, Wulfred initially enjoyed good favour with Coenwulf. Unlike his predecessors, his coins are the first to make no reference to the King, 
thus ending the recognition of a Mercian overlord on archepiscopal coins. Instead they depict a tonsured head of the archbishop himself, 
presumably influenced by the Carolingian-style silver denarii, which had recently been adopted by Pope Hadrian I (cf. CNG 61, lot 2185). 
Wulfred was a considerable benefactor to his Church, and a strenuous assertor of its rights, spending many years reforming his own cathedral 
community at Christ Church and granting land in exchange for assurances that his reforms would be maintained. It was this dedication which 
lead to the relationship between King and Archbishop souring considerably from 817 onward when Coenwulf stated his intention to release 
control of the monasteries from the clergy, which had been the custom for centuries, to laymen and local noble families. Concerned over a 
potential decline in pastoral standards, a bitter argument ensued and was evidently of such seriousness that according to historical sources, 
Wulfred ceased to exercise his office and at one point was threatened with exile unless he yielded to Coenwulf&apos;s demands. A settlement was 
finally imposed before Coenwulf&apos;s death in 821, but the quarrel rumbled on, continuing under his successor Coelwulf in 823 before finally 
being resolved in Wulfred&apos;s favor in 825 under the new Mercian King Beornwulf. According to the Canterbury obituary lists Wulfred died on 
the 24th March 832, leaving the bulk of his estates in trust for his community at Christ Church, Canterbury.

on king&apos;s face. The earliest known coin for the Rye mint, and a unique mule of types for Henry I. 
($2000) 

Found northeast Norfolk, 2018. 

This remarkable coin is the earliest known issue of the excessively rare mint of Rye. Furthermore, it is the only recorded mule of an obverse of 
BMC type V and a reverse of type VII for the reign of Henry I. According to the currently accepted ordering of Henry&apos;s 15 known types, our 
coin is an extraordinary four type mule. The existence of such a mule might arguably stretch the bounds of credibility in the current accepted 
sequence. It is only conceivable if production at Rye was so limited and sporadic that none of the intervening types were struck there, and the 
obverse die was brought back into production perhaps as much as eight to ten years after it was first issued.

A New Type for the Pembroke Mint

extremely rare Welsh mint. 
($5000) 

Found near Horncastle, Lincolnshire, 2018. 

Arnulf of Montgomery founded Pembroke as a stronghold in 1093 during the Norman invasion of South Wales following the death of Rhys 
ap Tewdwr, the last king of Deheubarth. The castle was entrusted to the brilliant warrior Gerald of Windsor (c.1075-1135), who successfully 
defended it against a series of Welsh assaults that regained much territory that had been lost to the Normans. During Gerald&apos;s command, a 
mint was established at Pembroke and the Pipe Roll of 1129-30 records &apos;the moneyer Gillopatrick&apos; rendering accounts. Very few coins are 
known today for Pembroke. 

Gerald of Windsor married Nest, the daughter of Rhys ap Tewdwr, a much celebrated beauty of her age. As a young woman Nest had been 
a hostage in the Norman court and became a concubine of the future Henry I, bearing him a son. The children of Gerald and Nest would 
become the progenitors of several of the great Anglo-Norman and Anglo-Irish dynasties. Many famous people can claim descent from &apos;the 
sons of Nest&apos; including John F. Kennedy!

Ex Morton &amp; Eden 91 (7 December 2017), lot 201; Archbishop Sharp Collection (1644-1714). 

Dr. John Sharp (1644-1714) was a clergyman who rose through the offices of the Church of England to become Archbishop of York in 1691. 
Sharp started collecting coins in 1687 and focused his energies primarily on the issues of the British Isles, acquiring many highly important 
rarities. Sharp was in contact with several other leading numismatists of his age, including Ralph Thoresby, to whom he addressed his 
manuscript, Observations on the Coinage of England, published in 1785. The great 19th Century numismatist, Rogers Ruding, regarded this 
work as, &quot;the first systematic treatise ever composed on the subject.&quot; On Sharp&apos;s death, the collection was left to his son and was kept together 
for some 250 years by his descendants. Two dispersals were made in the 1960s: Sotheby, 14 March 1966 (European, Spanish American, 
together with miscellaneous coins and medals) and Glendinings, 5 October 1977 (British, Charles I to Queen Anne). On 7 December 2018, 
Morton and Eden sold the coins from Anglo-Saxon times through to James I and some medals. In the words of the late Harry Manville, &quot;Sharp 
pedigrees are among the oldest available in British numismatics.&quot;

($750) 

Once an independent Viking kingdom, the Isle of Man was granted in perpetuity to Sir John Stanley, first Earl of Derby, by Henry IV in 1406 
on the condition that two falcons be rendered to each of Henry&apos;s successors at their coronations. Accepting these conditions, the Stanleys 
ruled as Kings of Man until 1651 and then as Lords of Man until 1736. The majority of Manx coins issued during this period bore the Stanley 
family crest and motto on the obverse, with the badge and motto of the island on the reverse. The family motto &apos;Sans Changer&apos; was interpreted 
locally as &apos;short of change&apos;, a sarcastic reference to the scarcity of low denomination coinage, a notorious problem, which had left the island 
riddled with forgeries and resulted in the Tynwald Act of 1733 rendering all previously produced coinage illegal. The 1733 coinage was struck 
by Amos Topping and Samuel Dyall, successors of William Wood, and proved highly popular with the islanders, being described as the most 
beautiful ever circulated on the island.
