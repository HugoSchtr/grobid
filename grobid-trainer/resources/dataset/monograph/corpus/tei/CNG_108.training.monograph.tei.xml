AUCTION TERMS 

All written, fax, email and phone bids must be received by 5PM (ET) May 15, 2018 

The Electronic Close starts at 10AM ET on May 16, 2018. Lots close every 20 seconds. 

To participate in this sale electronically you must be registered and approved to bid on www.cngcoins.com. 

Please read the auction terms for new information regarding bidding, buyer&apos;s fees, and payment of invoices. 

This is an internet and mail bid sale with an automated electronic close, con-
ducted by Classical Numismatic Group, Inc. (CNG). Bidding in the auction 
constitutes acceptance of the following terms: 

1. 
The property listed in this catalogue is offered for sale by CNG for itself 
and as agent for various owners and other consignors. We reserve the right 
to reject any bid, to determine the opening price, to set bidding increments, 
to vary the order of the auction, to reopen bidding in the case of a dispute, to 
withdraw any lot, to bid on behalf of CNG, to bid on behalf of the consignor, 
and to permit the consignor to bid on his own lots. CNG may loan or advance 
money to consignors or prospective bidders, and may have an interest other 
than commission charges in any lot. CNG may bid on its own account as an 
&quot;insider&quot; with information not available to the public. 

2. 
Lots will be sold in the order listed in the catalogue. The first lot will 
close electronically at www.cngcoins.com at 10AM Eastern Time on the 
sale date, with subsequent lots closing every 20 seconds thereafter. All 
written, fax, email and phone bids must be received by 5PM Eastern Time, on 
the day prior to the sale date. Electronic bids may be placed by approved bid-
ders up until the closing time of each lot. The electronic clock on the website 
represents the official closing time for each lot. Bidders intending to bid elec-
tronically must first register at www.cngcoins.com. New website registrations 
are processed for approval Monday through Friday 9AM-5PM Eastern Time 
only. No new registrations will be approved on the sale date. 

3. 
A 22.5% Buyer&apos;s Fee will be added to the hammer price of all success-
ful written, fax, email and phone bids. A 20% Buyer&apos;s Fee will be added to 
the hammer price of all successful electronic bids directly placed on www. 
cngcoins.com. 

4. 
All coins are guaranteed genuine. Attribution, date, condition and other 
descriptions are the opinion of the cataloguer, and no warranty is expressed 
or implied. Please note that an auction sale is not an approval sale. Lots 
examined prior to the sale and lots purchased by floor bidders (including bid-
ders executing commission bids on behalf of other parties) may not be returned 
for any reason except lack of authenticity. All claims of misdescription and all 
claims of return, except claims regarding authenticity, must be made within 5 
days of receipt of material. Any claim of lack of authenticity must be made 
in writing by the original purchaser immediately after discovery that an item 
is not authentic, and upon making such a claim the original purchaser must 
immediately return the lot to CNG in the same condition as at the time of the 
auction. Coins that have been encapsulated (&quot;slabbed&quot;) by a grading and/or 
authentication service may not be returned for any reason, including authen-
ticity, if they have been removed from the encapsulation (&quot;slab&quot;). If payment 
is made by credit card, rights of return are governed by these Auction Terms 
which supercede any rights of return promulgated by the card issuer. Estimates 
are intended as a guide only and not as a statement of opinion of value. 

5. 
Invoices are due and payable immediately upon receipt. Interest and late 
fees of 2.0% per month, or at the highest rate permitted by law, whichever 
is less, from the date of the auction, shall be payable on invoices not settled 
within 30 days of the auction date. Payment may be made by check or bank 
wire. Credit cards (Visa or MasterCard) will be accepted; credit card payments 
will not be accepted more than 14 days after the sale date. Payment by check 
must be made in either US dollars ($) drawn on a US bank or British sterling 
(£) drawn on a British bank. All successful bidders outside North America and 
the United Kingdom will be charged an additional $20 fee for bank charges 
that are the result of international wire transfer fees; this fee will be deducted 
for credit card or check payment as described above. CNG may reduce or 
compromise any charge or fee at its discretion. 

6. 
Bidders not known to us must provide satisfactory credit references or 
pay a deposit as determined at CNG&apos;s discretion before bidding. Minors are 
not permitted to bid without written consent of a parent guaranteeing payment. 
CNG may require payment in full from any bidder prior to delivery of lots. 
Title does not pass until lots are paid in full. Upon receipt of lots, the buyer 
assumes full responsibility for loss or damage. Delivery to the buyer&apos;s address 
of record shall constitute receipt by the buyer regardless of the identity of the 
person accepting delivery. 

7. Estimates are in U.S. dollars ($) and bids must be made in even dollar 
($) amounts. The CNG website, www.cngcoins.com, will execute electronic 
bids on behalf of all electronic bidders. Subject to reserves and opening prices, 
all electronic bids will be executed by the electronic software at one bidding 
increment (approximately 10%) over the next highest bid. All written, fax, 
email and phone bids received before 5PM the day prior to the sale date will be 
uploaded to the CNG website no later than the day prior to the sale date. These 
bids will not be subject to the minimum required bid cited on the website at 
the time of the upload. Any written, fax, email and phone bids received after 
the deadline or with special instructions will be executed at CNG&apos;s complete 
discretion and will be subject to the next bid required by the website. In the 
case of identical written, fax, email and phone bids, the earliest bid received 
wins. An electronic bid has priority over any identical written, fax, email or 
phone bid. Bid by lot number. No lot will be broken. Bidders are responsible 
for errors in bidding. Check your bids carefully. Electronic bidders may check 
their bids under User Services at www.cngcoins.com. 

8. A word on Reserves. CNG may place a reserve on any lot. However, no 
reserve will be higher than the estimate, and ordinarily lots are reserved at 60% 
of estimate. 

9. Bidders personally guarantee payment for their successful bids, including 
bidders executing commission bids from other parties and bidders representing 
corporations or other entities. Buyers accepting commission bids from other 
parties do so at their own risk and remain responsible for payment under these 
Auction Terms. 

10. In the event a successful bidder fails to make full payment within 30 
days of the auction date, CNG reserves the right to deem the sale incomplete 
and to resell the material, and the bidder agrees to pay for the reasonable cost 
of such a sale and also to pay any difference between the resale price and the 
previously successful bid. CNG reserves all rights that it is entitled to under 
the Pennsylvania Uniform Commercial Code, including the right to offset any 
sums due from a successful bidder against any future consignment or purchase 
or monies or goods in possession of CNG. 

11. Sales tax, postage, handling and insurance are the responsibility of the 
buyer and are added to all invoices where appropriate. For buyers in the 
European Union, CNG may import lots into the United Kingdom prior to 
shipment and charge buyers the import Value Added Tax. On any tax not paid 
by the purchaser which should have been paid, even if not invoiced by CNG, 
the purchaser agrees to pay the same on demand together with any interest or 
penalty that may be assessed. It is the responsibility of the buyer to comply 
with foreign customs and other regulations. 

12. Prices realized are published and are mailed with CNG&apos;s next publica-
tion. Prices realized are posted at www.cngcoins.com and successful electronic 
bidders are notified by email after the last lot of the sale closes. 

13. Bidders hereby waive any claim for incidental, consequential or exem-
plary damages arising from this auction. The sole remedy that any participant 
in the auction shall have for any claim or controversy arising out of the auction 
shall be a refund, without interest, of all or part of the purchase price paid by 
the participant. 

14. All rights granted by CNG or otherwise available to bidders and pur-
chasers, under these Auction Terms or otherwise, are personal and may not 
be assigned or transferred to any other person or entity, whether by operation 
of law or otherwise. No third party may rely on any benefit or right conferred 
by these Auction Terms. Bidders acting as agents must disclose the agency in 
writing to CNG prior to the auction; otherwise rights are limited to the agent 
and are not transferable to the undisclosed principal. 

15. Any dispute regarding this auction shall be governed by the laws of 
Pennsylvania and shall be adjudicated only by the Lancaster County Court 
of Common Pleas or the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of 
Pennsylvania; all bidders submit themselves to the personal jurisdiction of 
these courts for this purpose, consent to service of process by registered or 
certified mail, and waive any contrary provisions of Articles 14 or 15 of the 
French Civil Code and any similar provisions in any jurisdiction. All bidders 
consent to the confidentiality of consignors&apos; identities and waive any right to 
require disclosure of the name of the consignor or owner of any auction lot, 
whether such right is based on New York GOL  §5-701(a) or any other provi-
sion in any jurisdiction. In any dispute regarding this auction, the prevailing 
party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorney fees.

Demonstrating the usual flair shown by the die engravers in the service of Pyrrhos during his military expedition in Italy and Sicily, the small 
gold issues of 280/279 BC, depicting Nike and Leukippos (HN Italy 1629-1631), are of a refinement second to none. The traditional city 
founder is rendered in exquisite detail with the added novelty of his helmet being decorated with Skylla hurling a stone, the very embodiment 
of aggressive violence before the enemy in time of war.

In 446 BC, with the aid of Athens, the refugee population of the destroyed city of Sybaris returned to the location of their previous home, and 
founded a new city, giving it the name Thourioi. The new city quickly regained the prosperity enjoyed by its former incarnation, as evidenced 
by the extensive series of coins it issued over the following two centuries. Good relations with Tarentum were probably responsible for the 
weakening of Thourioi&apos;s historical connection to Athens, and she turned to Sparta during the Peloponnesian War. Although supported by 
Tarentum, the city suffered at the hands of the Lucanians and Brettians during the 4th century BC. In need of a more robust ally, the Thourians 
turned to Rome in 285 BC. Unlike many cities in southern Italy, Thourioi&apos;s support of Rome was steadfast during both the time of Pyrrhos 
and Hannibal&apos;s invasion, even though the Thourians suffered heavily at the hands of the latter. The coinage of Thourioi was diverse in both its 
denominations and metals. The primary types were the head of Athena, probably due to the city&apos;s initial close relationship with Athens, and a 
standing or butting bull, which had been the civic type on the coins of Sybaris.

This type is normally found on clearly billon flans, but this coin appears to be struck on a much higher quality metal. There are traces of the 
undertype visible, but none are distinct enough to suggest a particular issue, save for what appears to be the tail of a dolphin or hippocamp 
near the edge on the obverse, at the forehead of Herakles. The undertype must be of a similar weight standard. The only issue that seems to 
fit is the Ibero-Punic shekel with a male head on the obverse and a reverse featuring a prow facing right, below which a dolphin swims right 
(ACIP 543). These are typically silver issues, and many pieces are of a good quality silver, similar to that found here. If this identification of 
the undertype is correct, this would necessitate a redating of the present type, or the Iberian shekels, since the latter are traditionally dated circa 
237-209 BC, immediately following the Libyan revolt.

These coins were originally attributed to the Punic mint in Spain, but subsequent hoard evidence has established that they were struck either 
in Carthage or a Carthaginian mint in Sicily during the Second Punic War (see A. Walker, &quot;Some Hoards from Sicily and a Carthaginian Issue 
of the Second Punic War&quot; in Studies Mildenberg, p. 275, and note 6). Burnett (Enna) argued, based on the fixed die axes of the coins, that this 
issue was struck in Carthage, but for circulation in Sicily.

From the Colin E. Pitchfork Collection, purchased from Classical Numismatic Group, 10 November 2001. 

The reverse die used for this coin appears to have originally been engraved with the markings of Price 1178, then altered to remove both left 
field markings, and with the d˙ re-engraved higher in the left field and the civic monogram of Odessos added below the throne. The markings 
of Price 1178, which lacked the monogram of Odessos and had a Corinthian helmet in the left field above the letters, suggest that the die was 
originally intended for use at Mesambria, where such markings were canonical.

($5000) 

Ex Gorny &amp; Mosch 232 (5 October 2015), lot 111. 

The lion and bull design is common to the tetradrachms of Akanthos from the sixth to the early fourth century BC. The earliest tetradrachms 
are characterized by thick, dumpy flans, a variable style of incuse, and the head of the lion in three-quarter perspective. Subsequent issues, 
however, have a flan that is relatively thinner and broader, an incuse of a more regularly quadripartite style, and the head of the lion in profile. 
The floral symbol in the exergue, which first appeared in some of the earliest tetradrachms, became more stylized in these subsequent issues, 
as well. Subsequently, a pellet-in-annulet appeared above the lion in the upper field of the obverse, followed by the addition of a subsidiary 
letter, and, finally, letter combinations and symbols to distinguish later issues in this large series. 

Most of these tetradrachms show a stylistically archetypal lion attacking the bull, evidenced by its thick mane and bold joints and lines. 
However, two groups of tetradrachms (Desneux Types C and G) have felines that are represented with much finer lines, smooth joints, and a 
subdued, evenly constructed mane that Desneux identified as depictions of lionesses. Some dies show the lioness decorated with spots, leading 
some to suggest that it may be a panther, but the scene is certainly a representation of the archetypal lion and bull motif that was imported to 
Macedon from the east (Persia), and is found on many coinages of the period. 

The lion and bull motif appears frequently in art of the ancient Near East and ancient Greece (see Willy Hartner, &quot;The Earliest History of the 
Constellations in the Near East and the Motif of the Lion-Bull Combat,&quot; Journal of Near Eastern Studies 24 [1965], pp. 1-16, who identified 
its earliest representation on a prehistoric Elamite seal of the fourth millennium BC. For its appearance in Greek art, see the KY Painter in the 
National Archaeological Museum in Athens [Accession Number 12688] and Desneux, p. 55). Reliefs from the Persian capital at Persepolis 
depicting this same type and the Lydian coinage of this same period, though they do not show this type specifically, are surely a conscious 
echoing of a definitely masculine theme. 

Why then the use of a lioness, rather than a lion? Herodotos may provide a possible clue. According to him (7.125-126), the Persian army 
was attacked by lions (οἱ λέοντες) while bivouacking on the eastern fringes of Greece and Macedonia. In classical Greek, groups made up of 
both genders were expressed in masculine plural, so this incident more than likely would have included lionesses, who do most of the hunting 
for the pride. Since these animals and their habits would have been well-known to the regional population, as lions still roamed the area (as 
noted by Herodotos), the die cutter chose to be more accurate in his description of the scene, rather than following a more traditional Greek 
representation, since lions were rare or nonexistent in most of Greece by that time.

Taking advantage of the loosening of Athenian control over the Chalkidike due to the Peloponnesian War, in 432/1 BC the cities of the region 
formed themselves into a defensive coalition called the Chalkidian League, with its capital at Olynthos. The failure of Athens to break up 
this coalition -one of the terms of the Peace of Nikias in 421 BC -as well as a general strategic disinterest in the region, helped to solidify 
the League&apos;s power and position. As a result of this situation, the League began striking silver coinage in its own name. Adopting the local 
&quot;Phoenician&quot; standard already in use by Olynthos, only tetrobols were minted in any quantity at first, but after about 420 BC, tetradrachms 
were regularly struck. The very rare issues of gold staters, struck on the Attic standard, are certainly tied to the tumultuous events in the second 
quarter of the 4th century BC. 

The political situation in which the League found itself at that time was influenced by the competing interests of Athens, which had historic 
ties to the region, Sparta, which constantly sought to check any advance of Athenian power, and the Macedonian Kingdom, which sought to 
expand its influence over its neighbor to the south. Sparta&apos;s defeat at Leuktra in 371 BC, and the subsequent peace, provided Athens with the 
opportunity to reconstitute the Second Athenian Empire, beginning with the Chalkidike. In 365 BC, the Athenian general Timotheos began to 
conquer territory in the northern Aegean on behalf of Athens. He quickly subdued the island of Samos and gained a foothold in the Thracian 
Chersonese, from where he could direct his attention to the Chalkidike. With the help of Perdikkas III of Macedon, Timotheos attacked 
the League and its capital, Olynthos. Although unable to take the capital, Timotheos was successful in quickly capturing a large part of the 
League&apos;s territory. His campaign was so successful that he used the opportunity to attack his erstwhile ally, Macedon, as well. In 363 BC, 
in addition to seizing the city of Potidaia, an important Chalkidikan port near the League capital of Olynthos, Timotheos also captured the 
Macedonian ports of Methone, Terone, and Pydna, located in the Thermian Gulf. For all of his initial success against the Chalkidian League, 
however, Timotheos was unable to conquer Amphipolis, or solidify his hold over the areas he seized, and eventually abandoned his northern 
Aegean enterprise in 360 BC. In the years immediately following, it would be Amyntas&apos; youngest son, Philip II, who would achieve what 
both the Chalkidian League and Timotheos were unable to do -bring the entire region and all of its cities and tribes under one authority. In 
348 BC, Philip dissolved the League.

The city of Mende, located on the Pallene Peninsula on the eastern shore of the Thermaic Gulf, was founded by Eretria in the 8th century BC 
(Thucydides 4.123.1). It later founded colonies of its own: Neapolis on the eastern coast of Pallene, and Eion at the mouth of the river Strymon 
near Amphipols. Mende&apos;s wealth is indicated by the high amounts of tribute paid to the Delian Confederacy: eight talents until 451-450 BC, 
and then amounts ranging form five to nine talents after 438-437 BC. During the Peloponnesian War (431-404 BC), Mende originally sided 
with Athens, but then, on the urging of the oligarchs, went over to the Spartan general Brasidas. It eventually returned to the Athenian side, 
but is not mentioned in connection with the Peace of Nikias. From 415-414 BC, Mende again appears in the Athenian Tribute Lists, but by the 
fourth century the city was only minting copper coins.The Dionysiac types of Mende proclaim it as a famous wine producing city, as attested 
by its amphoras that have been found throughout the Mediterranean. On this delightful coin, Dionysos, who rules wine and winemaking, is 
shown being carried home drunk from a symposium, a representation of careless joy which links the world of men with the Olympians -at 
least until the morning.

This coin has the same control marks as Price 700, but differs from that issue in general style, the lack of small Nikai on the throne back, and 
the orientation of the trident head horizontally, rather than vertically. Noe noted and illustrated an example from the same dies that he observed 
in a &quot;Peloponnesian Hoard&quot; that has not otherwise been recorded. In his text, Noe observed the stylistic differences between that coin and the 
others at Corinth, and, though he does not state it directly, he suggests that it is not from the same issue, and possibly not the same mint. Later 
analysis of the Peloponnesian Alexanders, though, has shown that the coinage at this late date was struck for military purposes, and perhaps 
under hasty circumstances (demonstrated by the wide variance of styles and the use of dies far beyond their typical life span). As such, it 
is possible that the same circumstance that prompted the striking of coins of Price 700 re-emerged, requiring new dies made by a different 
engraver, whose style was markedly divergent from that of his predecessor.

From the BCD Triton IX catalog: &quot;This coin ... may have been part of a consignment of Peloponnesian staters sent north during the war so 
that they could be converted to Boiotian currency to better serve the military plans of the Allies against Athens. The obverse [die] of the 
undertype could only be Seltman, Temple, BD, BE or BG, all three of them belonging to the plentiful issues struck just before the beginning 
of the Peloponnesian War.&quot;

There are times when some of us wonder what the world would be like today if Alexander the Great had lived to a ripe old age. The same kind 
of &quot;What if ...&quot; thinking could be applied to Epaminondas. His premature death on the battlefield of Mantineia in 362 BC deprived Thebes of 
its greatest statesman and soldier, signalling the start of Thebes&apos; rapid decline into obscurity. If Epaminondas had lived to reap the benefits of 
his Mantineian victory, he would have undoubtedly proceeded to unite all Greece under his leadership. The next step would be to turn to the 
North and face Philip who, instead of finding a divided Greece ready for the taking, would think twice before attempting to invade Thessaly. 
Whether then there would be a clash between the two emerging superpowers or a truce between them, is anybody&apos;s guess. Perhaps Philip 
would remember the years he spent as a hostage in Thebes and his respect for the Theban statesman would prevail. The conquest of Asia would 
then materialize sooner and in a more permanent manner. But, like many great soldiers, Epaminondas inspired his men by leading them into 
battle and, instead of capitalizing on his genius, Thebes paid the price for his bravery.

Pantikapaion was founded by Greek colonists from Miletos in the late seventh century BC. Situated on the west side of the Cimmerian 
Bosporos, in what is now called the Crimea, it achieved great prosperity through its exploitation of the abundant fisheries of the straits and the 
export of wheat from the Crimea. This wealth is attested by its splendid gold coinage, which commenced in the mid-4th century BC, and by 
the magnificently furnished rock tombs of its principal citizens in the same period. Later, it was to become a regional capital of the kingdom 
of Mithradates VI of Pontos (120-63 BC) and later still the seat of the kings of Bosporos (first century BC -fourth century AD). The coinage 
of Pantikapaion seems to have commenced with silver issues in the latter part of the fifth century BC, but it is for its beautiful gold staters that 
the mint is chiefly noted. They depict the head of the god Pan (a pun on the name of the city) and on the reverse the griffin that Herodotos 
describes as being the guardian of the remote sources of gold.

MYSIA, Kyzikos. Circa 450-330 BC. EL Stater (15mm, 16.04 g). Demeter, wearing long chiton, himation draped 
over right arm, holding grain ear in left hand and scepter in right, seated left on tunny left / Quadripartite incuse square. Von 
Fritze I 201 (same dies as illustration [Boston MFA]); Greenwell -; Boston MFA 1544 = Warren 1433 = C. Greenwell, &quot;On 
some Rare Greek Coins&quot; in NC 1890, p. 21 and pl. III, 2; SNG BN -; SNG von Aulock -; BMC -; Dewing -; FSD -; Gillet 
-; Gulbenkian -; Jameson -; McClean -; Myrmekion -; Pozzi -; Rosen -; Weber -. Near EF, toned. Well centered. Extremely 
rare, the third known; only the Boston MFA piece published in the references, and only one in CoinArchives (Roma XIV, lot 
233 [hammer £30,000]). 
($10,000) 

This is undoubtedly one of the rarest issues of electrum from the mint of Kyzikos. The type was unknown upon the publication of Greenwell&apos;s 
catalog in the 1880s, though it was among others that he added in a supplemental article, while the piece was in the Warren Collection. The 
same piece, now in Boston, was then used to illustrate the issue in von Fritze, suggesting that it was still the only piece known. Von Fritze also 
did not identify any fractional pieces for the issue, nor did Hurter &amp; Liewald in their articles. None were reported in any hoards, including the 
impressive Myrmekion hoard, nor among the single finds reported in FSD. 

170. 
MYSIA, Kyzikos. Circa 450-330 BC. EL Hekte -Sixth Stater (10mm, 2.64 g). Eros standing left, astride bull 
crouching left, which he holds by its horns; below, tunny left / Quadripartite incuse square. Hurter &amp; Liewald I 9b corr. (Eros, 
not Nike); Von Fritze I -; Boston MFA -; SNG BN -; SNG von Aulock 1212; G.K. Jenkins, &quot;Greek Coins Recently Acquired 
by the B.M.&quot; in NC 1955, 15 corr. (same); CNG 96, lot 388 corr. (same); CNG 69, lot 351 corr. (same); Gorny &amp; Mosch 
204, lot 1457 corr. (same); Lanz 165, lot 88 = Lanz 160, lot 175. Good VF, lightly toned. Extremely rare, the finest of seven 
known. 
($2000) 

Prior to the discovery of the present piece, all examples of this issue, including the unique stater, were not very well preserved. As such, 
previous numismatists identified the figure on the obverse as Nike, but the cataloger of the Lanz 160 hekte thought that the physique of the 
figure was more akin to a male, and thus the figure must be Eros. However, all the characteristics of the figure were not definitively clear even 
on that piece, leaving the interpretation still questionable. On the present coin, though, certainly the finest of this issue, not only is Eros&apos; male 
musculature distinctly visible, so is his penis, which settles any dispute over the question of the figure&apos;s gender.

This is reportedly the &quot;in commerce (1982)&quot; piece that Price refers to in his corpus. Since the BN piece was acquired from H. Seyrig, who died 
in 1973, and no other example is published, the present coin would appear to be the only example that could have been in commerce in 1982.

There are numerous Alexander type issues without any control marks from disparate mints issued from the late 4th-1st centuries BC. Their 
mint of issue and dating can only be presumed from a careful comparison with other issues whose attributions are known. The present piece 
has a stylistic affinity to a variety of civic Alexander issues in Ionia and Caria in the mid-late 3rd century. Interestingly, Price appears to include 
only a handful of these unmarked issues, leaving out many that were even present in references he consulted.

($500) 

From the Colin E. Pitchfork Collection. Ex Classical Numismatic Group 57 (4 April 2001), lot 209. 

This is a remarkable coin in that it was overstruck on an unlikely undertype, and it also necessitates a total reevaluation of the 3rd century BC 
civic Alexander coinage at Magnesia. It is clear that this coin was overstruck on a tetradrachm of Rhodes signed by the magistrate Ameinias 
(Ashton 212); the left portion of the name that is split by the stem of the rose is visible on the reverse, as are portions of the rose and its floral 
base, above and below the name. What is perplexing is how the Rhodian issue was struck on an Attic weight flan, which is roughly 3-4 
grams heavier than the Rhodian standard at that time. Price 2509 is a Rhodian Alexander issue that bears a monogram that R. Ashton thought 
may resolve to the name Ameinias, and Price thought it possible that the two series, autonomous Rhodian and Alexander type, were struck 
in parallel. If so, then one could speculate that an Attic standard tetradrachm flan may have been mistakenly struck with dies made for the 
autonomous Rhodian tetradrachms. However, in his more recent compilation of the Rhodian coinage from 408-190 BC, Ashton placed these 
coinages in subsequent periods, which would suggest that an unintentional mixing of flans did not occur. In any event, the chronology that 
Ashton proposes for his series is quite firmly grounded, so his dating of circa 230-205 for the Rhodian civic coinage should be considered for 
dating the present issue. Price organized the civic Alexanders at Magnesia into logical groups based on hoards as well as a common program 
of marking. The 3rd century issues are divided into two groups, the earlier characterized by a single monogram in the left field and a maeander 
pattern in the exergue, while the later group adds a second monogram in the left field. These are dated circa 282-225 BC and circa 225-200 
BC, respectively. Having only one monogram, the present coin should fall into the earlier group, especially as there is an issue that has this 
exact monogram in retrograde (Price 2024). However, this coin is obverse die linked to Price 2046, from the later group. This suggests that 
the simple arrangement that Price lays out for the 3rd century should be revised, with the present issue being clearly late in the century, since 
the Rhodian undertype was not struck until circa 230 BC at the earliest. 

191. 
IONIA, Magnesia ad Maeandrum. Circa 200-196 BC. AR Tetradrachm (30mm, 16.91 g, 12h). In the name and

head of horse right above fl; maeander pattern in exergue. Price 2049 var. (second monogram in left field, horse head below

Coinage of Kroisos 

The &apos;Kroisos&apos; type coinage is one of the most recognizable of all ancient Greek coinage. All of the issues in the bimetallic, gold and silver, 
series feature the same confronted lion and bull foreparts on the obverse, and two incuse punches (or a single punch in the case of small 
denominations) on the reverse. It is thought that the series began on a &apos;heavy&apos; standard, with gold and silver staters of equal weight, around 
10.6-10.7 grams, which was later reduced to about 8.17 grams for the gold. More recently, though, studies have shown that coins of both 
standards circulated together, but that the heavy standard was only used for a relatively short time compared to the light standard, which 
continued to be used into the Persian period. The Kroiseids have also traditionally been broken down into two stylistic groups, &apos;realistic&apos; and 
&apos;stylized&apos;, with hoard evidence suggesting that the former belonged to the time of Kroisos, while the latter were of the time of the Persians.

Four Rarities from Antioch ad Maendrum 

The Carian city of Antioch, located near the eastern end of the Maeander valley, was founded on the south bank of the river Maeander, where 
the river is joined by a major tributary, the Morsynos River, flowing north from Aphrodisias. It was a Hellenistic settlement that was founded 
by Antiochos I Soter (though some argument has been advanced in favor of Antiochos III), likely through a synoecism of two villages, 
Symmaithos and Kranaos (Pliny, NH 5.108). The location was a significant crossing point of the Common Road over the Maeander, between 
the important cities of Tralles, to the west, and Laodikeia on the Lykon, to the east. Given its important location, surprisingly little is known 
today about Antioch in the Hellenistic period; there is little mention of the city in contemporary literature and epigraphy, and the site remains 
unexcavated. In contrast, the city took on a much more important role in the Roman period, when it was fortified, and figured significantly in 
many emperors&apos; eastern campaigns. 

Its strategic location along a major trade route certainly must have enriched the city, which grew to a considerable size by the first century 
AD, spanning both sides of the Maeander (cf. Strabo 13.4.15). While the Roman provincial coinage at Antioch is quite sizable, the Hellenistic 
civic coinage is quite rare. All the civic issues date from the 2nd-1st centuries BC, and primarily consist of bronze coins, with very rare issues 
of silver tetradrachms and drachms. The types are fairly consistent across all denominations, with the obverse featuring the portrait of either 
Zeus or Apollo, with the reverse featuring a zebu bull or (very rarely) an eagle standing on a thunderbolt. Interestingly, some of the coins bear 
the name of a magistrate, while others do not. 

The silver is all traditionally dated to the 2nd century BC, and may have begun with a couple rare issues of Alexander type tetradrachms that 
M.J. Price (following H. Seyrig) tentatively placed there, circa 190-180 BC, but it is more likely that they are issues of Tabai (cf. Price p. 311). 
No Seleukid issues are currently attributed to Antioch, but there are many western issues that are unattributed from the reigns of Antiochos 
I through Antiochos III, so it is possible that some of these issues may actually belong to this city. Three of the four tetradrachms offered 
here are unique, while the fourth is the second known of a particular issue. All four are tied into the known coinage by virtue of their types, 
legends, and magistrates. Perhaps most interesting is the first lot, which is a stephanophoric type tetradrachm -a type previously unknown 
for this city. If it was struck alongside the other stephanophoroi in western Asia Minor in the mid-2nd century BC, this tetradrachm may be 
the earliest of the silver; it notably bears the longer legend &quot;Of the people of Antioch by the Maeander,&quot; rather than the usual &quot;Of the people 
of Antioch&quot; that is canonical on all other Hellenistic issues of Antioch.

The previous lot is a tetradrachm also in the name of Diotrephes, and is likely an issue from the same individual named here, but struck during 
his first iteration as a magistrate.

234. 
CARIA, Mylasa (or Kaunos). Mid 3rd century BC. AR Tetradrachm (28mm, 17.08 g, 12h). In the name and types 
of Alexander III of Macedon. Head of Herakles right, wearing lion skin / Å¬E$Å@droU, Zeus Aëtophoros seated left; labrys 
in left field. Price 2074 (Miletos or Mylasa); Thompson, Alexandrine, Group 3, 20; SNG Saroglos 435. Superb EF, attractively 
toned. A splendid and attractive example, nicely toned and sharply struck. 
($7500) 

This coin is actually quite astounding in its monumental sculptural quality. The third century witnessed an outpouring of emotionally powerful 
and, as compared to the more restrained canons of the Classical period, flamboyant works of art; of which this is a perfect example. While the 
solid figure of Zeus on the reverse has a noble three-dimensional quality, the head of Herakles on the obverse is so filled with exuberant life 
that it is quite simply over the top. When this head is compared with those on lifetime Alexander issues from Macedonian mints, Babylon, and 
Alexandreia, the difference in emphasis and feel is obvious. 

235. 
CARIA, Uncertain (Mylasa?). Circa 500-450 BC. AR Stater (19mm, 10.88 g). Head of lion left, foreleg below / 
Incuse square divided once diagonally. Traité I 915, pl. XXV, 19 = BMC Cilicia p. 90, 1 (Issos); cf. SNG Ashmolean 318 and

The portraits on coins in the later Lycian series are among the finest of the Classical period. Among the earliest to attempt depictions of 
their rulers on coinage, the Lycians&apos; first portraits in the later 5th century BC were innovative, but static, idealized forms lacking individual 
characterization. Over the next half-century, however, the style progressed significantly toward realism, culminating in the issues of the 
dynasts Mithrapata and Perikles in the early-mid 4th century BC. The coins of Mithrapata came first, depicting on their reverse the profile 
portrait of a man with distinctive elderly features. Through the relative chronology established in L. Mildenberg&apos;s die study, one can even 
see the portrait become more aged as time progressed, reflecting the realism that had been captured in these issues. The coins of Perikles, 
Mithrapata&apos;s successor, continue this trend. Interestingly, both Mithrapata and Perikles are depicted without any sort of satrapal headgear, 
which was always included in earlier Lycian portraits, perhaps indicating that they had declared their independence from the Persian king. 
Unfortunately, these astonishing developments in portraiture came to an abrupt end in Lycia when Maussollos of Caria invaded the region 
circa 360 BC.

Ex Numismatik Naumann 53 (7 May 2017), lot 305 (realized €4000, before cleaning). 

The animal on the obverse here, and on the following lot, appears to be the same creature featured on the obverse of other obscure early issues; 
see CNG 105, lot 393 (same denomination); CNG E-369, lot 140 and CNG E-321, lot 167 (obols); and CNG E-361, lot 748 (hemiobol). All 
of these coins have a similar style, and perhaps are from a single mint. 

251. 
ASIA MINOR, Uncertain. 5th century BC. AR Sixth Stater -Hemidrachm(?) (11mm, 1.91 g). Bull(?) standing 
right, head reverted / Quadripartite incuse square. CNG E-277, lot 25 (same die and punch); otherwise unpublished. Good VF, 
toned, a little granular. Very rare. 
($500) 

252. 
ASIA MINOR, Uncertain. 5th century BC. AR Twelfth Stater -Diobol(?) (9mm, 1.16 g, 6h). Head of bull 
right within dotted linear square border / Gorgoneion facing within incuse square. Cf. CNG E-174, lot 59 (sixth stater -
hemidrachm[?]); otherwise unpublished. VF, lightly toned, slightly granular. Extremely rare. 
($300) 

This type is unpublished, but similar pieces are known for Abydos and Kebren in the Troad (and also possibly Gergis; see Triton XVI, lot 437), 
where the obverse features the civic badge of the city (the eagle at Abydos, and the ram at Kebren) and the reverse has a facing gorgoneion 
in an incuse square. The style of the gorgoneion here is also consistent with these other issues. If the coin is another issue from Troas, two 
cities stand as possibilities, Assos and Lamponeia, as both cities used a bull&apos;s head as a civic badge on their coinage. However, the motifs 
here are fairly common in the 5th century BC, and both Assos and Lamponeia always depict the bull&apos;s head as facing, not left or right, so the 
attribution to either is speculative.

&quot;Bring me the head of the Baptist&quot; 
Aristobulus and Salome -Struck at the Beginning of the Jewish War 

253. 
KINGS of ARMENIA MINOR. Aristobulus, with Salome. AD 54-92. AE (22mm, 7.99 g, 11h). Dated RY 13 (AD 
66/7). [∫å45]¬EW4 år54to∫oU¬oU Et [5˝], diademed and draped bust of Aristobulus left / ∫å45¬54-4˙4 4å¬[o]Â˙4, 
diademed and draped bust of Salome left. Meshorer 365 corr. (date); Hendin 1257a (same obv. die as illustration); RPC I 3840 
corr. (same). Near VF, brown patina, faint old cleaning marks. Extremely rare, apparently the ninth known. ($30,000) 

Salome is described in the Gospels (Matthew 14 and Mark 6) only as the daughter of Herodias, who asked Herod Antipas for the head of John 
the Baptist in return for her daughter&apos;s risqué dance for the king. Salome&apos;s name is supplied by Josephus in Antiquities 18.5, where he also 
informs us that she grew up to marry her great-uncle Philip the Tetrarch and, after Philip&apos;s death, her cousin Aristobulus, who is featured on 
the obverse of this coin and with whom Salome had three sons. Aristobulus was the son of Herod V of Chalkis and great grandson of Herod 
I, and was appointed king of Armenia Minor in the first year of Nero&apos;s reign. 

The present issue was struck in 66/7 CE (year 13 of Aristobulus&apos; reign), the first year of the Jewish war and around 40 years since the execution 
of John the Baptist, which has been tentatively dated to some time between 25 and 29 CE. Hendin (5th ed., p. 275) suggests that Aristobulus 
struck this issue for propagandistic and political purposes, in the first year of the war, as a show of loyalty to Rome and his patron Nero. 

When RPC was published, citing three known examples of this type, the date was off the flan on two pieces and the one example with partial 
date had been tentatively read as date Α or Η (RPC p. 570). Frank Kovacs subsequently discovered an example with a clear date 13 (Hendin 
p. 275, pl. 24, same obverse die as the present coin), and Kovacs&apos; opinion was that other reported dates were most likely mis-readings of that 
date. The publication of additional specimens has since confirmed Kovacs&apos; opinion, and it is now clear that all coins of this type are dated 
year 13.

From the Colin E. Pitchfork Collection, purchased from Freeman &amp; Sear, 18 January 2002. 

A variety of the Arabian mints began operations with imitations of Alexander type. However, the style of this piece, particularly the reverse, 
is only roughly similar to any of those. Moreover, the weight of this coin is correct for the Attic standard, while most of the known imitations 
from Arabia are much lighter. This suggests that the present coin, the style of which is also closer to the original Alexanders, was struck 
earlier, perhaps even in the late 4th century BC. If correct, this would be one of the earliest , if not the earliest, Alexander type coins from 
Arabia.

and 16.5 grams), as well as a variety of symbols in the left field on the reverse: lion-skin over club [Price 4058], dolphin downward [Price 
4058A (cf. Lanz 161, lot 15)], wreath [Price B36], two dolphins entwined over wreath [present coin], and thunderbolt [CNG 90, lot 752, and 
Rauch Summer Auction 2010, lot 54]. While the light weight and style suggest an origin among the eastern Celts, the consistency of the style 
and proper epigraphy suggest a more formally organized mint, unlike definitively Celtic issues that attempt just to copy existing Alexanders 
(or are clearly blundered).

This type is thought to have been issued in celebration of the Ptolemaic victory over the Seleukids at the battle of Raphia during the Fourth 
Syrian War. Official propaganda proclaimed that these two deities, Serapis and Isis, had intervened on behalf of the Egyptians, saving them 
from defeat (see C. Lorber, &quot;The Ptolemaic Era Coinage Revisited,&quot; NC 2007, p. 116, and L. Bricault, &quot;Serapis et Isis, Sauveurs de Ptolémé 
IV à Raphia,&quot; Chronique d&apos;Égypte LXXIV (1999), pp. 334-43). 

Thomas Landvatter, in his die study cited above that appeared in the 2012 ANS American Journal of Numismatics (Second Series, Vol. 24, p. 
88), suggests that this issue was &quot;carrying a very specific ideological message directed more widely throughout the empire: Ptolemy IV was 
equating himself and his wife Arsinoe with the divine sibling-spouses Serapis and Isis.&quot; Landvatter also notes that &quot;[t]his was an ideological 
statement made during wartime, meant to have wide appeal and explicitly associate the Ptolemaic king and queen with two of the most popular 
deities in the Eastern Mediterranean.&quot; Indeed, the popularity of the Serapis/Isis cult would outlive the Ptolemaic dynasty and continue well 
into the Roman Imperial period, only to be eventually usurped by the Christian and Muslim faiths.

From the Colin E. Pitchfork Collection. Ex Triton XI (7 January 2008), lot 124. 

By the 2nd century BC, most imitative issues of Alexanders were stylized issues easily identifiable as &apos;Celtic&apos; or &apos;barbarous.&apos; The present 
piece, however, would have been highly deceptive, as the style is very close to that used at various mints in southern Asia Minor, and is 
betrayed only by the retrograde N in Alexander&apos;s name, and very minor stylistic elements. The closest parallels, in terms of style, are issues of 
Rhodes, which had the small hash marks at the bottom of the lion skin and Zeus sitting on a throne with its back depicted. Another possibility, 
if the kerykeion was present on the model, would be the rare issue from Samothrace, circa 200 BC, Price 662. That issue has a somewhat 
similar style, but lacks the throne back and also has a monogram below the throne-these small differences, though, suggest that the engraver 
was not closely copying an official issue, and that the kerykeion was an arbitrary symbol used to give the impression of authenticity.

From Phil Davis: 

I think you can rule out a Civil War issue or anything else even quasi-official with complete confidence. The mis-matched types and garbled 
legends aren&apos;t consistent with any Civil War issue I&apos;m aware of anyway. This is surely an ancient imitation. 

I&apos;m more hesitant about firmly describing it as Geto-Dacian though. It doesn&apos;t &quot;look&quot; particularly Dacian to my eye, but I&apos;m still being sur-
prised by coins which, based on find-spot and context, unquestionably are Dacian, so that by itself isn&apos;t a particularly persuasive argument 
either way. There are other considerations though. The primary &quot;peak&quot; period of Dacian minting was in the 80s-70s BC; too early for this 
coin. There was a secondary peak in the 40s BC, which fits nicely with the Cr-440/1 reverse of 49 BC, but is too early for the Octavian shield 
&quot;obverse&quot; of 30-29 BC. That late date isn&apos;t impossible for a Dacian coin-I believe the Dacians continued to strike some silver straight 
through to Trajan&apos;s conquest-but it is later than most. That date is more consistent with the Eraviscan imitations, but I mention that only in 
passing, for completeness. I&apos;ve no reason at all to suspect this is Eraviscan; it surely isn&apos;t. 

It&apos;s sort of ironic: I spent a fair amount of effort getting people to stop calling every RR imitation &quot;Celtic&quot; and to consider the possibility that 
many or most were in fact Dacian, but I&apos;ve learned to be cautious about categorically using that description as well. The complicating truth 
is that there were other peoples imitating RR denarii around the same time; in Central Europe, in Thrace, in Serbia and Bulgaria, who knows 
where else. Some of these may in fact have been struck by Dacians, whether traders or imperialists; others seem to have been struck within a 
sort of Dacian economic sphere but by non-Dacian peoples. I&apos;m also starting to consider whether some originate in Spain as well, clearly not 
by Geto-Dacians (but ironically hinting that there just might be something in the Civil War notion after all!)

The Astronomical Diary gives us the precise date for the death of Hyspaosines on 10/11 June in year 188 of the Seleukid Era (124 BC). We 
are told further that Hyspaosines&apos; widow, Talasi&apos;asu ordered that their minor son Apodakos should &quot;sit on the royal throne of his father&quot; 
(see A.J. Sachs and H. Hunger, Astronomical Diaries and Related Texts from Babylonia. Vol. III: Diaries from 164 B.C. to 61 B.C [Wien: 
Österreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften.Wien, 1996]), pp. 282-283: 

Astronomical Diary No. -123A (BM 33024+33045) 

Obverse: Month III 188 SE = 2/3 June -30 June/1 July 124 BC: 

18: [.... Asp]asine, king of [M]esene, .... [....] .... the 5th day (6/7 June 124 BC) of this month he became ill and on the 9th (10/11 June 
124 BC) he died of illness. Afterwards, the nobles [....] 
19: [....] .... [....] .... [....] these apprentices must not give any decision. At the command of Talasi&apos;asu, his wife, the nobles [....] 
20: [....] .... Afterwards, she made one small (minor) boy, his son, sit on the royal throne of his father Aspasine [....] 

As a minor, however, Apodakos did not immediately become king, and hence he issued coins in his father&apos;s name until at least SE 193 (see this 
coin and the next lot). The present group of tetradrachms spans the period from the lifetime of Hyspaosines through the minority of Apodakos 
and finally the period when Apodakos issued coins in his own name (see lots 402-405).For a more detailed discussion, see G.R. Assar, &quot;A

From the Belgica Collection. Ex Lanz 162 (6 June 2016), lot 64 (hammer £1000). 

Son of a wealthy politician and famed orator of the same name, Quintus Hortensius was a loyal supporter of Julius Caesar and was appointed 
governor of Macedon by the dictator in 44 BC. Following the assassination of Caesar soon afterward, control of Macedon was sought out both 
by the Second Triumvirate and the Liberatores. Hortensius backed his nephew Brutus and was able to maintain the governorship of Macedon 
until his death at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC. 

This is one of three Macedonian issues to bear the name of Quintus Hortensius. The authors of RPC suggest that the two larger denominations 
should be assigned to Dium, while this smaller denomination was issued for Cassandrea (based on the two other issues, the &quot;D&quot; in the reverse 
legend does not mark the coin as belonging to the colony of Dium, but rather refers to Hortensius&apos; post as praefectus coloniae deducendae).

($300) 

From the Belgica Collection. Ex Classical Numismatic Group 75 (23 May 2007), lot 798. 

An enigmatic coin. Head (BMC) assigned this issue to Thessalonica, but Touratsoglou (Die Münzstätte von Thessaloniki in der römischen 
Kaiserzeit [1988], p. 43, no. 69) rejected this attribution, instead suggesting an uncertain mint in Asia Minor. Nonetheless, the coins are 
similar to the Thessalonican issues with Divus Julius Caesar/Augustus, which Touratsoglou attributed to the time of Domitian (RPC dates 
these to the time of Augustus). The question hinges on what to make of the ΘE in the reverse legend: does it function as an abbreviation for 
ΘEΣΣAΛONIKEΩN or does it identify Augustus as a θεος, thus indicating this issue was struck after his death? 

It should be noted the die links claimed in CNG 75 are erroneous, and there is no clear indication that the reverse legend was recut. Thus the 
present piece offers no conclusive evidence that this issue was struck in Thessalonica, as was stated in the 2007 sale.

($2000) 

Gaius Cassius Longinus took part in the campaign against Parthia that culminated in the Battle of Carrhae, one of Rome&apos;s most humiliating 
military losses, where he served as quaestor to the general Marcus Licinius Crassus. When Crassus was killed in the battle, Cassius retreated 
to Syria with the remaining Roman army and assumed the governorship from 53-51, at which time this rare series of tetradrachms was struck. 
He returned to Rome in 50 BC amidst the growing conflict between Julius Caesar and Pompey, choosing to serve as naval commander for the 
latter. Caesar eventually pardoned Cassius and even appointed him legate. This proved a fateful move, for despite Caesar&apos;s clemency, Cassius 
became one of the chief architects in the plot to assassinate the dictator perpetuo in March of 44 BC. Two years later, following his defeat at 
Philippi, Cassius took his own life with the same dagger that he used to stab Caesar.

Two Antioch Issues from Artistic Dies 

462. 
SELEUCIS and PIERIA, Antioch. Mark Antony &amp; Cleopatra. Circa 36-34 BC. AR Tetradrachm (26mm, 13.75 g, 
12h). BACIΛICCA KΛЄOΠATPA ΘЄA NЄωTЄPA, diademed bust of Cleopatra right, wearing earring, necklace, and 
embroidered dress / ANTωNIOC AVTOKPATωP TRITON TPIωN ANΔPωN, bare head of Antony right. McAlee 174; 
Prieur 27; BMC 53; RPC I 4094; HGC 9, 1361. Good VF, toned, granular surfaces. Exceptional strike. 
($20,000) 

The obverse legend is usually translated as &quot;Queen Cleopatra, the younger goddess&quot; or &quot;...the newer goddess.&quot; Ted Buttrey (&quot;Thea Neotera,&quot; 
MN VI [1954], pp. 95-109) read the legend rather differently: &quot;Queen Cleopatra Thea, junior.&quot; Essentially, this would make her Cleopatra 
Thea II and thus the namesake of the Seleucid queen Cleopatra Thea (ruled 125-121 BC), the daughter of Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II. Buttrey 
argued that such tetradrachms of Antony and Cleopatra officially mark Cleopatra as reigning &quot;not as Egyptian conquerer but as a Seleucid 
queen.&quot; 

463. 
SELEUCIS and PIERIA, Antioch. Galba. AD 68-69. AR Tetradrachm (27mm, 14.33 g, 12h). Dated RY 2 (AD 68/9).

First Issue with the Portrait of a Jewish King 

466. 
JUDAEA, Herodians. Herod IV Philip, with Augustus. 4 BCE-34 CE. AE (21.5mm, 7.12 g, 12h). Caesarea 
Philippi (Panias) mint. Dated RY 5 (1/2 CE). [KAICA]PO[C] CЄ[BA]CTOY, bare head of Augustus right / ΦIΛIΠΠOV

($3000) 

This issue was the first to carry the portrait of a Jewish King. David Hendin (p. 257) notes: &quot;Philip was able to immortalize his face on his 
coins largely because so few Jews lived in the territories over which he ruled. Jews would have taken this act as an insult and violation of the 
Mosaic Law against &apos;graven images&apos;.&quot; 

Philip is repeatedly mentioned in the New Testament (see Matthew 14.3; Mark 6.17-29; Luke 3.1, 3.19).

Similar reverse types were struck under both Caracalla (198-217 CE) and Elagabalus (218-222 CE). Their reigns overlapped the life of 
Rabbi Yehudah Ha-nasi (b. 135, d. about 220 CE), who lived in Sepphoris and was chief redactor and editor of the Jewish oral law called the 
Mishnah. 

Since the time of the Jewish War, when Sepphoris remained &quot;pacifist&quot; (according to Josephus), the city had an unusual relationship with Rome 
(Sepphoris was also called Irenopolis, or city of peace). This coin, conceived and authorized by the council of Sepphoris, carries an important 
reverse legend, clearly stating a special relationship between Rabbi Yehudah&apos;s Sepphoris and Rome. 

Meshorer reconstructed these highly abbreviated and slightly differing legends as &quot;Diocaesarea the Holy, City of Shelter, Autonomous, 
Loyal (a treaty of) friendship and alliance with the Romans&quot; (Meshorer, Y. &quot;Sepphoris and Rome&quot; in Mørkholm, O. and Waggoner, N. [eds.], 
Greek Numismatics and Archaeology: Essays in Honor of Margaret Thompson, Wettern, Belgium, p. 167). Kraay reconstructs it with a slight 
difference: &quot;Diocaesarea the Holy, City of Shelter, Autonomous, loyal friends and allies with the Holy Council (i.e., the Senate) and the People 
of Rome&quot; (Kraay, C.M. &quot;Jewish Friends and Allies of Rome,&quot; American Numismatic Society Museum Notes 25 [1980], pp. 56).

Hercules&apos; Tenth Labor -The Cattle of Geryon 

472. 
EGYPT, Alexandria. Antoninus Pius. AD 138-161. AE Drachm (32mm, 20.63 g, 12h). Dated RY 10 (AD 146/7). 
Laureate head right / L ΔЄ-KA-TOV (date), Hercules standing left, grabbing horn of one of two bulls of Geryon with right 
hand, holding club and lion&apos;s skin in left; at feet to left, the dead body of Eurytion lying left. Köln 1542; Dattari (Savio) 2621;

For his tenth labor, Herakles was required to travel to Erytheia to capture the Cattle of Geryon. En route, while crossing the Libyan Desert, 
he became so frustrated at the heat that he shot an arrow at Helios. Admiring the hero&apos;s courage, Helios gave him the golden cup, which 
Helios used to sail nightly across the Ocean from west to east, and Herakles used it to help him reach Erytheia. Upon arriving there, Herakles 
was confronted by the two-headed watchdog, Orthros, and the herdsman Eurytion, each of whom he killed with his club. Hearing what was 
happening, Geryon, armed with three shields, three spears, and wearing three helmets, pursued Herakles to the River Anthemus. Once there, 
Herakles shot Geryon dead with an arrow he had poisoned with the blood of the Lernaean Hydra. To annoy Herakles as he drove the cattle 
back to Eurystheus, Hera sent a gadfly to scatter the herd by biting them. After a year&apos;s labor, Herakles recovered the herd, but was further 
hindered by a flood, also caused by the goddess. Herakles eventually returned to Tiryns, and Eurystheus sacrificed the cattle to Hera.

ROMAN REPUBLICAN COINAGE 

A Spanish Conundrum 

475. 
Anonymous. Circa 3rd-2nd century BC. PB Quadrans(?) (86mm, 598 g, 10h). Uncertain mint in Spain(?). Head right, 
wearing crested Corinthian helmet (Mars or Minerva?) / Horse leaping left on ground line; • • • above. Unpublished, nothing 
similar listed in CPM. As made, warm brown patina, some roughness on reverse, deep gouge on cheek. 
($3000) 

The present lead enigma is unlike anything this cataloger has ever seen. The Republican aes grave-like size and denominational markers 
suggest that it could be a quadrans or teruncius from sometime around or before the Second Punic War. Stylistically, some comparison can be 
made to the Roman didrachm/litra coinage of circa 240-230 BC (Crawford 27/1, 26/1, and 25/1). The piece originates from Spain, but either of 
these periods would vastly predate the majority of the Iberian lead pieces, which were mostly civic or private issues of the mid 1st century BC 
or later. It is also significantly larger and more official in nature than any of the lead tokens or coins from the ancient world. Perhaps it is a lead 
substitute currency, but that would require a tremendous leap in thinking for a culture that still effectively viewed bronze as a precious metal. 
It cannot be a lead ingot, as those were never so finely formed and circular as this, and we can find no weight standard in which it would fit. 

We welcome suggestion or comment.

The revolt of Rome&apos;s Italian allies (&lt;i&gt;socii&lt;/i&gt;, hence &apos;Social War&apos;) broke out toward the end of 91 BC and was the culmination of long 
standing grievances occasioned by the Senate&apos;s inept handling of Rome&apos;s relations with its longtime Italian allies, who sought equal rights 
with Roman citizens. The Marsi were especially prominent in this movement, hence the name &apos;Marsic Confederation,&apos; which is often applied 
to the rebel state. The main fighting was in the years 90-89 BC and the rebellion assumed alarming proportions when both consuls for 90 BC 
were defeated by rebel armies. Rome appeared to be in serious danger of defeat and was thus forced to grant Roman citizenship to the rebels. 
Thereafter, all of Italy south of the Po was united by this common bond. 

The coinage of the Marsic Confederation is of great interest, consisting principally of silver denarii, some of which bear the names of the rebel 
generals. This specimen records a certain Caius Papius [Mutilus], consul of the rebel state and commander of the Samnite forces. Mutilus 
was defeated by Sulla in the later stages of the war and his subsequent history is uncertain, though it is possible that he survived to extreme 
old age when a wealthy man described as &quot;a leader of the Samnites during the Social War&quot; was proscribed by the Triumviral government in 
43 BC (cf. Appian, Civil Wars, iv. 25). The reverse depicts an oath-taking scene symbolizing the unity of the confederation of Italian states. 
Interestingly, the entire coin type is closely modeled on an issue of the moneyer Tiberius Veturius whose coinage is dated by Crawford (234/1) 
to circa 137 BC. Veturius&apos; reverse shows two soldiers taking the oath and is generally interpreted as referring to an agreement made with the 
Samnites in 321 BC (treaty of Caudium). This would have made it especially appropriate for an issue of the Samnite leader in the Social War.

As consul for the year 88 BC, Sulla was awarded the coveted assignment of suppressing the revolt of Mithradates VI of Pontus, but political 
maneuvers resulted in this assignment being transferred to Marius. In response, Sulla turned his army on Rome, captured it, and reclaimed his 
command against Mithradates. His prosecution of the first Mithradatic War was successful, but he spared the Pontic king for personal gain. 
In 83 BC, Sulla returned to Italy as an outlaw, but he was able to win the support of many of the leading Romans. Within a year he fought his 
way to Rome, where he was elected dictator. It was during this campaign to Rome that this denarius was struck. The obverse type represents 
Sulla&apos;s claim to be acting in Rome&apos;s best interest. The reverse shows Sulla enjoying the highest honor to which a Roman could aspire, the 
celebration of a triumph at Rome.

From the Jonathan P. Rosen Collection. 

Faustus was the son of Lucius Cornelius Sulla, the famous general and dictator of Rome (138-78 BC). The coin portrays Sulla&apos;s first great 
victory, in which he ended the Jugurthine War. Jugurtha, grandson of Massinissa of Numidia, had claimed the entire kingdom of Numidia and 
divided it between several members of the royal family, in defiance of Roman decrees. Rome declared war on Jugurtha in 111 BC, but for five 
years the wily king frustrated all efforts to bring him to heel. Finally, in 106 the popular general Marius was assigned command, with Sulla 
as quaestor in charge of cavalry. Before Marius could take to the field against the enemy, however, Sulla arranged with his ally Bocchus of 
Mauretania to have Jugurtha ambushed and captured. Sulla was acclaimed for the bloodless end of the war, gaining his first victory and the 
eternal enmity of Marius.

A temple to Juno Moneta (Juno &quot;the Advisor&quot;) was dedicated on the Capitoline Hill in 344 BC and its grounds served as Rome&apos;s first mint. 
The association between this temple and the minting of coinage was such that the English words &quot;mint,&quot; &quot;money,&quot; and &quot;monetary&quot; derive 
from &quot;moneta.&quot;

The aurei of L. Munatius Plancus were distributed during Caesar&apos;s triumph of October 45 BC, celebrating his final defeat of the Pompeians 
at Munda the previous year. This triumph raised some concerns in Rome, as it marked a victory over fellow Romans, an event never before 
deserving a triumph. Such actions only heightened the fears in some quarters over Caesar&apos;s intentions, fears which lead to his assassination 
six months later. 

Before his murder Caesar appointed Plancus governor of Transalpine Gaul, where he founded the colony of Lugdunum.

treasury after he had contemptuously spurned the title of king which the terror-stricken Rhodians had offered him. The aplustre was a common 
symbol of naval superiority, while the floreate endings of its branches allude to the rose, the civic emblem of Rhodes.

Extremely rare. 
($3000) 

This issue may have been struck as Antony and L. Munatius Plancus were moving their forces across Greece toward the coast of Epirus. 
Plancus was a supporter of Antony until the triumvir&apos;s failed Parthian campaign, at which time he shifted his allegiance to Octavian (Suetonius 
[Aug. 7] informs us that it was at Plancus&apos;s suggestion that Octavian took the name Augustus). 

Remarkably, Plancus&apos; tomb, built atop Mount Orlando at the seaside town of Gaeta, Italy, has survived. The tomb&apos;s inscription recounts the 
greatest achievements of his career: 

Lucius Munatius Plancus, son of Lucius, grandson of Lucius, great-grandson of Lucius, 
consul, censor, twice imperator, septemvir epulonum, 
having triumphed over the Raetians, 
built the temple of Saturn from the spoils; 
parcelled out land in Italy at Beneventum; 
and in Gaul, founded the colonies of Lugdunum (Lyon, France) and Raurica (Basel, Switzerland). 

Sear (CRI p. 256) suggests that the tall vessel on the reverse &quot;may relate to his [Plancus&apos;] membership of the priestly college of the Epulones 
whose function was to supervise certain sacred banquets.&quot;

Found near Usk, Monmouthshire in the late 1990s and recorded by Rodney Hudson at Newport Museum (with ticket in his hand). 

In circa AD 55, the Twentieth Legion, Valeria Victrix, was moved to Burrium, (present day Usk) to control the restive local tribe, the Silures. 
Burrium was the first Roman fortress in Wales. While stationed there the Twentieth took part in the defeat of the Ordovices tribe and the 
invasion of the island of Anglesey, the center of British Druidism. Subsequently detachments from the Legion fought at Watling Street in the 
great battle that brought to a bloody end the revolt of Boudica. In AD 66, the Twentieth was sent to Viroconium (Wroxeter) and Burrium was 
abandoned.

He (i.e., Galba) showed marked respect to Livia Augusta, to whose favor he owed great influence during her lifetime and by whose last will 
he almost became a rich man; for he had the largest bequest among her legatees, one of fifty million sesterces. But because the sum was 
designated in figures and not written out in words, Tiberius, who was her heir, reduced the bequest to five hundred thousand, and Galba never 
received even that. (Suetonius 5.2) 

The line of the Julio-Claudian emperors had died out with Nero, but the new emperor Galba still wished to demonstrate continuity with the 
dynasty that had ruled for the last century, via his close friendship with Livia.

Prior to the discovery of the present coin, there had been no known coins of Titus that were struck during his first consulship, which he served 
in AD 71 following his arrival in Rome from Judaea. The surprising absence of any such coin, given the momentous events of the previous 
year, was first noted by the renowned eighteenth century numismatist J.-H. Echkel (Doctrina II:6, p. 352 [Vienna, 1828]). It is evident from 
the numismatic evidence of the Flavian dynasty that the consulships of the emperors were meticulously recorded on the coinage. The presence 
of COS without an ordinal number on this coin, therefore, indicates that this sestertius was definitely struck during Titus&apos; first consulship. As 
such, this is the first issue of Titus from the mint at Rome. 

See F. Schmidt-Dick, Die Römischen Münzen des Medagliere im Castelvecchio zu Verona (Vienna, 1995), 4903 for the same reverse die, but 
paired with an obverse with COS II legend.

Deaccessioned from the British Museum by exchange on 14 February 1980 (a copy of a note from R. A. G Carson, documenting the exchange, 
will be provided to the winner of this lot upon request). Acquired by the British Museum from the E. W. Wigan Collection in 1872. 

Edward Wright Wigan (1823-1871) was an avid coin collector who built upon a collection of Anglo-Saxon and English begun by his uncle, 
John Alfred Wigan, and also acquired a number of other important collections, such as the Roman gold collection of Prosper Dupré, the 
collection of Jewish coinage of Félicien de Saulcy, and the Baktrian collection of James Gibbs. He was also active in buying from public 
sales, and acquired pieces at auction from the collections of the Earl of Pembroke, the Duke of Devonshire, and Thomas Thomas. Nearly all 
of his Roman gold was presented to the British Museum in 1864, and published in the Numismatic Chronicle 1865 (F. W. Madden, &quot;Account 
of a collection of Roman gold coins, presented by Edward Wigan, Esq., to the Department of Coins and Medals, British Museum&quot;, pp. 1-56). 
At the same time, his Jewish collection was published by F. W. Madden in his History of Jewish Coinage (London, 1864). Upon his death, 
Wigan&apos;s collection was purchased by Rollin &amp; Feuardent, and the BM subsequently purchased many of his Greek and Roman coins from 
them with a Treasury Grant of £10,000.

Struck from the same obverse die as other medallic types dated to AD 139 (see Gnecchi pl. 46, 9-10; Banti 302, 307). 

The central portion of the shield decoration on the reverse is unclear. The upper area depicts two figures, with that on the right seemingly 
dismounting from a ship, and thus we might interpret this as Aeneas and Ascanius arriving at Latium. At the bottom we find a cave containing 
an animal, possibly a she-wolf but, if the identification of the two figures as Aeneas and Ascanius is correct, more likely the sow that will direct 
Aeneas where to found his city. To the right, at about the shield&apos;s mid-height, appears to be a river-god, whom we are able to more confidently 
identify as the Tiber.

Struck with the same dies as the Triton XXI example (lot 775), this piece has been made to a weight approximating a genuine aureus. 
However, as the core consists of lighter base metal, the specific gravity of these counterfeits is obviously inconsistent with genuine aurei.

Hadrian, childless and without either a successor or heir, chose Lucius Ceionius Commodus as his adopted son in AD 136, and renamed him 
as Lucius Aelius Caesar. Aelius was sent to the Roman province of Pannonia to serve as governor, where he died of tuberculosis in AD 138. 
Hadrian now made his second choice for his heir, Titus Aurelius Fulvus Boionius Antoninus. Hadrian actually wanted Marcus Aurelius to 
succeed him on the throne, but realized that Aurelius was far too young, so instead he went with the highly respected Antoninus. As a condition 
of his adoption, and to ensure an orderly line of succession, Antoninus Pius adopted both his nephew, Marcus Aurelius, and Aelius Caesar&apos;s 
son, Lucius. The relatively young Lucius would change his name to Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus, but he would later drop Commodus 
and add Verus after ascending to the throne, along with his adoptive brother and co-ruler Marcus Aurelius. The present type depicts the two 
&quot;brothers&quot; and co-rulers clasping hands with an inscription noting the &quot;harmony&quot; between the two Augusti.

The reverse of this highly interesting issue depicts a military exercise known as the decursio. Although coins of Nero also depicts the drill, 
these earlier issues render this event from the ground level. The closest surviving artistic parallels for the Geta type are the well-known scenes 
of a decursio from the base of the Column of Antoninus Pius, which employ a similar bird&apos;s-eye view.

Beginning in AD 208, Septimius Severus waged a military campaign against the Caledonians in northern Britain with his sons Caracalla and 
Geta. Due to his father&apos;s illness, Caracalla took the lead in managing military operations throughout most of the campaign, while Geta took on 
administrative duties at the campaign base camp at Eboracum (modern York). By AD 210, all three family members were depicted on coins 
celebrating their success. This sestertius refers to the end of the British campaign. The obverse legend records Geta&apos;s newly adopted title, 
&quot;Britannicus,&quot; while on the reverse Victory is engraving a shield as a memorial to the closing of the campaign.

The son of Odenathus, the ruler of the rich eastern trade center Palmyra, and his wife Zenobia, Vabalathus was declared king following the 
murder of his father in AD 267. Since Vabalathus was still in his minority, Zenobia took over as regent, using the confusion following the 
death of Gallienus to expand Palmyrene power. In AD 269, the Palmyrenes seized control of Egypt and, with it, the Roman grain supply. 
To bolster her position, Zenobia laid claims to an illustrious ancestry, including Cleopatra VII of Egypt and the legendary Dido of Carthage. 

The emperor Aurelian recognized the threat posed by Zenobia and Vabalathus and launched a campaign. In AD 272, Palmyra was sacked and 
both Zenobia and Vabalathus were captured as they tried to make their way to Persia. The two were to be brought to Rome and paraded in 
Aurelian&apos;s triumph in AD 274, but apparently only Zenobia survived the journey.

When the emperor Carus assumed the purple, he elevated his sons, Carinus and Numerian to the rank of Caesar. Carus left Carinus in 
command of the western half of the empire, while he and Numerian traveled east to campaign against the Sasanian Persians. During this time, 
Carinus successfully led campaigns against the Germans and Britons, who tried to take advantage of the emperor&apos;s absence. This aureus was 
likely issued to proclaim these successful campaigns.

Ex Tkalec (24 October 2003), lot 412. 

Earlier facing head portraits can be found on aurei of Postumus, Carausius, Maxentius, and Constantine I, but the great rarity of these issues 
today suggests they were only struck in very limited quantities for special occasions or were experiments that failed to gain traction. The 
facing head aurei of Licinius I and II, struck for their tenth and fifth anniversaries, respectively, thus mark the first effort to put facing-head 
aurei into general circulation in somewhat sizeable numbers and set a precedent for what will eventually become the norm for later Roman 
and Byzantine issues. 

It is often remarked that while earlier portraits of emperors attempt to capture individuality (not necessarily reality), late Roman portraits 
subsume individuality in favor of a quasi-divine image. While the Licinian issues are not devoid of individualized features (see for example, 
NAC 62, lot 2093, which shares the same reverse die as our coin but carries a more mature portrait of Licinius II wearing long sideburns), 
through their rigid frontality and intense gaze they transfix the viewer in a startlingly bold and immediate way. They are, like religious icons 
of their time, both didactic and devotional.

The presence of AVGGG rather than AVGG on the reverse places this coin between AD 402 and 408, during the reign of Honorius, Arcadius, 
and Theodosius, but it must certainly date to the waning days of Arcadius&apos; reign, immediately preceding or contemporary with the similar 
&quot;TESOB&quot; coinage of Theodosius II and Honorius, which also features Victory and kneeling figure(s) as a shield design (see D. M. Metcalf, 
&quot;Minting at Thessalonica in the fifth and sixth centuries and the gold currency of Illyricum and Dalmatia,&quot; SEBGC [1988], nos. 1-2 and 19-20; 
our coin is certainly by the same hand as Metcalf no. 19 [= Glendining, 25 November 1953, lot 206]). Following Metcalf&apos;s chronology, this 
series of coins was then replaced with issues with the reverse legend ending AVGG, thus following the death of Arcadius in May AD 408, and 
with two subsequent shield designs: 1) Victory standing left on prow; and 2) horseman riding right.

Following the death of Valentinian II in May AD 392, his Frankish magister militum, Arbogast, hailed Eugenius emperor of the West. The 
newly acclaimed emperor, a professor of grammar and rhetoric, seemed a suitable selection as he posed little threat to Arbogast&apos;s military 
ambitions. Eugenius, however, antagonized the eastern emperor Theodosius I by replacing Theodosius&apos; officials with his own loyalists, 
greatly hampering the eastern ruler&apos;s control over the West. Moreover, Eugenius&apos; sympathetic attitude toward pagans and the old Roman 
religion was completely at odds with Theodosius&apos; persecution of paganism. By May of AD 394, Theodosian forces were advancing west, with 
the two imperial armies meeting in combat at the Battle of Frigid River in September of AD 394. Theodosius&apos; forces were victorious, with 
Eugenius being captured and executed, while Arbogast committed suicide. The victory left Theodosius as sole ruler over the whole empire 
(the last emperor to hold this position), and greatly hastened the decline of paganism in the West.

After the death of Libius Severus, the western half of the Roman Empire was without an emperor for over a year. The power was wielded 
de facto by Ricimer, and Leo was either too busy or did not feel there was a need to nominate an emperor. Matters changed, however, 
probably as a result of a Vandal raid into Greece, and Leo designated Procopius Anthemius emperor of the western provinces to deal with 
the Vandal menace issuing from Africa under their king, Gaiseric. The expedition against Gaiseric was a total failure from the start due to the 
incompetence of the joint commander from the East, Leo&apos;s brother-in-law Basiliscus. With the failure to defeat the Vandals and anti-Greek 
feelings in Rome, Anthemius was unpopular and eventually Olybrius, with the aid of Ricimer, usurped power. Anthemius was killed by the 
barbarian soldier Gundobald as he attempted to flee Rome.

Mint Error or a New Variety? 

728. 
Maurice Tiberius. 582-602. AV Solidus (21mm, 4.24 g, 6h). Light weight issue of 23 siliquae. Constantinople mint, 1st 
officina. Struck 583/4-602. Helmeted, draped, and cuirassed bust facing, holding globus cruciger / Angel standing facing, holding 
long staff surmounted by staurogram and globus cruciger; A//CONOB. DOC (7a) var.; MIBE 11 var.; SB 481 var. (all with star on 
obv. and rev.). Superb EF. Unpublished variety, or mint error using dies of SB 478 on flan of SB 481. 
($500) 

There are three possibilities regarding the attribution of this coin. The types are that of SB 478, regular weight solidi, while the flan is that of 
the light weight solidi, SB 481. Other than the weight difference, the coins of SB 481 add a star to the obverse and reverse type. One possibility 
is that this coin is the result of a mint error, where dies for the regular weight series were mistakenly used on light weight flans. Another is 
that the mint had to strike light weight solidi before the dies were made with the star added to the types, so pre-existing dies from the regular 
weight series were used. A final possibility is that the light weight series began with the exact same types as the regular series, and the star was 
added shortly after to distinguish between the two denominations.

The career of the official Anastasius is well known from the surviving sygillographic evidence, although our seal is possibly unpublished 
and may shed new light on this figure, whom Nesbitt and Oikonomides (DOCBS I pp. 63-4) described as a &quot;a wealthy businessman who 
farmed out the office of general kommerkiarios of several provinces between 718 and 727.&quot; Anastasius only seems to be recorded as genikos 
kommerkiarios of the Hellespont for indiction year 5 (721/2), and, aside from the current piece, there does not appear to be any evidence that 
he served as genikos kommerkiarios of Lycia. 

For overviews of Anastastius&apos; career, see BLS Vol. I/1, p. 158, Table 13 (and catalog numbers 223-4, 226-7, and 230-1), as well as PBE I

Clothaire III has the historical distinction of being the first of the rois fainéants, or &apos;do-nothing kings,&apos; of the Merovingian Dynasty. Although 
this may be true of his final years, the earlier part of his reign was quite busy, although Clothaire relied on both his mother and trusted advisors 
to rule on his behalf. The son of Clovis II, Clothaire succeeded his father while still a child. Consequently, a regency formed under his mother, 
Balthild. Subsequently, Clothaire&apos;s chief advisor and defacto ruler, Erchinoald, mayor of the palace. Upon Erchinoald&apos;s death, the Frankish 
nobles chose Ebroin, a man who proved himself to be a violent despot. Although Clothaire tried to exert some real authority when he achieved 
adulthood in 669, it was too little. His premature death in the spring of 673 only worsened the situation.

Approximating its appearance and weight to English issues from the time of Edmund to Eadgar (939-975), this coin combines the stylistic 
feature of coins originating in the west midlands of England with the use of rosettes on the reverse. The legends, however, indicate that this 
coin belongs to a small and very rare group of Anglo-Carolingian hybrids. Only two other such coins or groups of such coins -all found in 
France -have been identified (Naismith, p. 224, notes 6 &amp;7). 

In the case of our coin, the legends confirm the association with other Anglo-Carolingian coins. The obverse legend, FELЄCHΛИIS, more 
closely resembles the mint name of the town of LeMans (Cinomanis), rather than any Anglo-Saxon ruler, while the moneyer on the reverse, 
Conguion, can be assocated with the modern Breton personal name, Goyon. According to Naismith (p. 225), this suggests a origin in Brittany 
for this type, struck following the return of the Breton leadership from sanctuary in England in 936 and continuing until the 940s.

Bulgarian Coins &amp; Seals from the Iconodule Collection 

Founded in 681, the First Bulgarian Empire lasted until 1018, when it was annexed into the Byzantine Empire. It remained under Byzantine 
control until 1185 with the formation of the Second Bulgarian Empire. During its existence, the First Bulgarian Empire was involved in 
checking some of the major nomadic migrations, and in 717/8 it allied itself with the Byzantines, helping to defeat a Muslim siege of 
Constantinople and delay by several centuries the Islamic push into Europe. The First Empire was also involved in checking both the Avars 
and the Magyars, and stemmed the so-called second wave of the Great Migrations occurring during that time. During this period, Bulgaria 
prospered under rulers such as Simeon I Veliki, during whose reign the country experienced its first Golden Age. By the eleventh century, 
however, it was in decline and the Krum dynasty, which had ruled Bulgaria since the ninth century and had seen the country though a period 
of expansion and conversion to Christianity, died out. Under Samuil Comitopuli there was a period of resurgence, but within a few years of 
his death, Bulgaria was absorbed by the Byzantines. 

The Second Bulgarian Empire began in 1185. After a period of expansion under Ivan I [Koloyan] (1197-1207) and Ivan Asen II (1218-1241), 
the country experienced a second Golden Age under Ivan Aleksander (1331-1371), but it was short-lived as his sons broke away parts of the 
kingdom into their own independent territories. After 1371, Bulgaria, now divided, grew ever weaker, and by the end of the fourteenth century 
was a much-reduced shadow of its former self. 

Please note that all of the following Bulgarian coins, lots 816-901, are from the Iconodule Collection. 

816. 
BULGARIA, First Empire. Boris-Mihail. Knyaz, 852-889. PB Seal (28mm, 25.95 g, 12h). Struck 864-889.

III.1A. VF, brown patina. Rare and attractive for type. 
($500) 

The reign of Boris-Mihail began with numerous setbacks. During the previous decade, Bulgaria had been fighting a two-front war against 
the Carolingians in the west and the Byzantine Empire in the east. This period was rife with shifting alliances, as the regional non-aligned 
states frequently changed sides among the three warring powers. In 864, the Byzantine emperor Michael III invaded Bulgarian territory on 
the pretext that, while Boris-Mihail was prepared to convert to Christianity, it was unacceptable that he would do so by following the Latin 
rite. In return for receiving territory held by the Byzantines, Boris agreed to be baptized according to the Orthodox rite, and in September 865 
assumed the new name of Boris-Mihail, after that of the emperor. Boris also adopted the title &quot;Knyaz,&quot; or Duke. The adoption of Christianity 
had two effects: Boris was now in command of a Christian state, and would be able to negotiate with the rest of Christendom more easily; and 
the Byzantines now had an Orthodox ally that they hoped they could treat as a subordinate buffer against the western Roman Catholic powers 
and a source of manpower for their wars against the encroaching Ottomans.

($750) 

By the beginning of the reign of Simeon I Veliki, the First Bulgarian Empire was poised to take on the Byzantines. Styling himself as a ruler 
on par with the Byzantine emperor, Simeon adopted the title &quot;Tsar of the Bulgarians and Autocrat of the Greeks.&quot; Between 894 and 896, he 
defeated the Byzantines and their allies in the so-called &quot;Trade War,&quot; and, at the Battle of Bulgarophygon, he brought an end to the war with a 
rout of the Byzantine army. Following the death of the Byzantine emperor Alexander in 913, Simeon once again invaded Byzantine territory, 
but halted his plans when he was offered official recognition of his full imperial title, and a marriage between his daughter and the infant 
emperor, Constantine VII. The Byzantine court rejected the settlement and war was shortly renewed. On 20 August 917, Simeon fought the 
Byzantines, devoid of any allies, at Anchialus. Simeon, however, was prevented from taking Constantinople, although the Bulgarians took 
control of much of the Balkans.

holding patriarchal cross on globe between them. Jordanov Type III.3Аa. VF, beige patina. 
($300) 

In 927, a peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire officially recognized the transfer of the imperial title to Simeon&apos;s son and successor, Petr I, 
his marriage to the emperor&apos;s daughter, Maria Lakapena, who was now known as Irina (&quot;peace&quot;), as well as the independence of the Patriarch 
of Bulgaria. However, the peace was short-lived, as a power struggle between Petar and his brothers ensued. The weakness this internecine 
struggle created resulted in the loss of territory, renewed invasions of neighboring peoples, including the capture of Preslav in 968, and the 
rise of religious schism. 

821. 
BULGARIA, First Empire. Petar I, with Irina (Maria Lakapena). 927-969. PB Seal (20mm, 7.19 g, 12h). Struck

($300) 

Known as Todor prior to his proclamation as tsar in 1185, Petar, along with his younger brother Ivan Asen, took advantage of Bulgarian unrest 
over Byzantine overlordship to rebel against the empire. In 1185, after a series of earlier abortive attempts, they were successful and Todor 
declared himself tsar, or independent ruler, taking the name Petar IV, an act designed to legitimate his reign by associating himself with the 
previous First Bulgarian Empire. The rebellion took on religious overtones when an icon of St. Dimitrii of Solun was miraculously discovered 
at the rebel capital of Turnovo, signaling that Saint&apos;s assistance in Bulgarian independence. Over the next several years, the Byzantines tried 
unsuccessfully to put down the rebellion and recover the territory lost to them. After major Byzantine defeats near Tryavna, Arcadiople, and 
Serres, Bulgarian ascendancy seemed to be checked by the murder of Asen at the hands of his cousin Ivanko, and in 1197 by the murder of 
Peter IV, and the succession to the throne of his youngest brother, Kaloyan. 

823. 
BULGARIA, Second Empire. Ivan Asen II. 1218-1241. AE Trachy (30mm, 2.34 g, 6h). Thessalonica mint. Facing 
bust of Christ, raising hand in benediction and holding Gospels / Ivan Asen II and St. Dimitrii standing facing, holding star-
tipped staff between them. Raduchev &amp; Zhekov 1.2.2; Youroukova &amp; Penchev 35-6; D&amp;D 2.2.1. VF, dark green-brown 
patina. 
($300) 

The succession of Ivan Asen II reversed a trend of territorial loss and, once again, Bulgaria engaged in a policy of territorial expansion. 
After recovering the lands lost to it under Boril, Ivan Asen II then occupied Odrin and Albania. Through diplomacy, he regained the cities 
of Belgrade and Branicevo which had been lost to Hungary, as well as some lands from the Latin Empire. Following Ivan&apos;s major success at 
Klokotnitsa in 1230, the Epirus Despotate became a Bulgarian vassal. In an inscription from Turnovo in 1230 he entitled himself &quot;in Christ 
the Lord faithful Tsar and autocrat of the Bulgarians, son of the old Asen.&quot; The Bulgarian Orthodox Patriarchate was restored in 1235 with 
approval of all eastern Patriarchates, thus putting an end to the union with the Papacy. Ivan Asen II had a reputation as a wise and humane 
ruler, and opened relations with the west, especially Venice and Genoa, to diversify the trade of his country. The country enjoyed flourishing 
economy, trade relations were diversified, and around 1235 Bulgaria organized its own navy. In early 1241, Ivan Asen II defeated a column of 
the Mongol army of Batu Khan as it was retreating from Hungary. This defeat, however, was not decisive, and a new Mongol invasion came 
not long after Ivan&apos;s death, forcing Bulgaria to become tributary to the Golden Horde.

($200) 

Son of Ivan Asen II and Irene Komnene Doukaina, Mihail was seven or eight years old when he rose to the throne. His reign was marked by 
a series of conficts with the Empire of Nikaia during the reigns of John III Doukas (Vatatzes) and Theodore II Doukas-Laskaris. He reached 
peace the with latter, but the terms of the treaty outraged many of the leading nobleman. A plan was hatched to replace Mihail with his cousin 
Kaliman Asen, and Mihail was soon assassinated.

($200) 

Mico Asen ascended the throne by virtue of his marriage to Maria, a daughter of Ivan Asen II. Little is known about him. Becoming emperor 
of Bulgaria after the murder of his wife&apos;s cousin, Kaliman Asen II in 1256, he had some support in the capital, but was largely opposed by 
the rest of the nobility. After an unsuccessful campaign against Theodore II Doukas-Laskaris, Emperor of Nikaia, Mico lost control even over 
the commoners. When Konstantin I Tikh was proclaimed emperor, Mico and his family fled to Michael VIII Palaiologos and sought refuge 
in Nikaia. Here he was given lands in the Troad, where he remained with his family. The date of his death is unknown, but it is likely that he 
was no longer alive in 1277/8, when his son Ivan Asen III was put forward as a claimant to the Bulgarian throne by the Byzantine Emperor 
Michael VIII.

Konstantin I Tikh was elected by the nobles in 1257 to replace the ineffective Mico Asen. To legitimize his claim, he married Eirene of 
Nikaia, a daughter of emperor Theodore II Doukas-Laskaris by Elena of Bulgaria, the daughter of Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria. From 1259 to 1261 
Konstantin warred against Béla IV of Hungary, during which time the Hungarians captured the Bulgarian town of Vidin. Two years later, the 
Bulgarians recovered Vidin under the leadership of Jakov Svetoslav, who became its independent ruler (1263-1275). Due to the expensive and 
unsuccessful wars, repeated Mongol raids, and economic instability that followed, a revolt ensued in 1277. Its leader, the swineherd Ivailo, 
was successful and managed to take the Bulgarian throne for a time (1277-1280) following Konstantin&apos;s death.

While the actual birth date and parentage of Georgi Terter I, who ruled as tsar of Bulgaria from 1280 to 1292, are uncertain, it is certain that 
he had at least one brother, Aldimir (Eltimir), who married the sister of the young tsar Ivan II and was appointed despotēs in 1298 in return for 
protection against his uncles as well as the advancing Mongols under Chaka. Prior to his accession, Georgi Terter I allied himself with Ivan 
Asen III, which included sending his son Theodore Svetoslav to Constantinople as a hostage, and marrying the sister of Ivan Asen III. In return, 
Georgi Terter I was appointed despotēs. When Ivan III Asen fled the country in 1280, Georgi Terter I seized the throne. His first move was to 
try to ally himself with Carlo I d&apos;Angiò and Stefan Dragutin to remove Michael VIII Palaiologos and restore the Latin kingdom. When this 
move failed and the Mongols of the Golden Horde under Nogai Khan began ravaging Bulgaria, Georgi Terter I in 1284 engaged his daughter 
Anna to Stefan Uroš II Milutin. In addition, he recovered his son Theodore Svetoslav from Constantinople and appointed him as co-tsar. A 
second Mongol invasion in 1285, however, forced him to send his son this time as a hostage (along with a daughter) to Nogai Khan. While 
there, the young girl married Nogai&apos;s son Chaka. Possibly prompted by the Mongols, in 1292, Georgi Terter I fled to Constantinople. Fearing 
a possible Mongol reprisal, the Byzantines hesitated receiving him at court; instead, Georgi Terter I remained for a while in Adrianople, before 
he was finally transferred east. In 1301, his son Theodore Svetoslav, now tsar, recovered his father from the Byzantines and confined him to a 
comfortable exile, until Georgi Terter I&apos;s death in 1308/9.

Todor Svetoslav was the son of Georgi Terter I. Until 1289, he was given as a hostage, first to the Byzantines and later to the Mongols of 
the Golden Horde. In 1298 or 1299, Todor attempted to invade Bulgaria with the assistance of his Mongol brother-in-law Chaka. They were 
successful for a while, and Chaka ruled as tsar. However, Todor Svetoslav soon betrayed Chaka, had him murdered and himself became tsar in 
1300. Todor was vindictive, punishing all who stood in his way, including those who had helped in his rise to power. In the face of his brutality, 
the nobility revolted and attempted to replace him with Byzantine assistance. Over the next several years, warfare continued until a peace was 
reached and war ended with a peace treaty in 1307. The result was relative peace between Todor Svetoslav and his neighbors until his death.

Georgi Terter II was the son of Todor Svetoslav, and after his father&apos;s death in 1321 he became actively involved in the civil war in the 
Byzantine Empire, between Andronikos II Palaiologos and his grandson Andronikos III Palaiologos. Taking advantage of the situation, Georgi 
invaded Byzantine Thrace, conquered Plovdiv and part of the surrounding area in 1322. Later that year, however, the Bulgarians were defeated 
by Andronikos III. While the Byzantine emperor was preparing for an invasion of Bulgaria, Georgi died.

($500) 

Mihail Asen III was the son of the despotēs Šišman of Vidin and a distant cousin of Todor Svetoslav and Georgi Terter II. Since the middle 
of the 13th century, Vidin had been effectively autonomous under ineffective Bulgarian overlordship, and the title of despotēs signified this. 
When Georgi Terter II died in 1323, Mihail Asen III was elected emperor of Bulgaria. 

Although Mihail managed to force Andronikos III to retreat, the Byzantines took Plovdiv. Mihail was able to recover Bulgarian control over 
northern and northeastern Thrace in 1324. A subsequent peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire, which was to be concluded by Mihail&apos;s 
marriage to Theodora Palaiologina, the sister of Andronikos III Palaiologos, who had previously been married to Todor Svetoslav of Bulgaria. 
To marry Theodora, Mihail divorced his first wife Anna (Neda), a sister of the Serbian King Stefan Uroš III Dečanski, a move that resulted in 
a worsening of relations with Serbia. Even the rival Byzantine emperors took sides, and for the next several years, a series of wars were waged 
against the Serbs and their Byzantine allies. 

This type has caused some confusion since neither of Mihail&apos;s two wives was named Irene. It is thought that Theodora may have adopted the 
name, which means &quot;peace,&quot; as her marriage to Mihail was one of the conditions of the treaty reached between the Bulgarians and Byzantines. 
The taking of the name would serve as &quot;a symbolic commemoration of the rapprochement that her marriage to Michael brought to the two 
warring lands&quot; (D&amp;D p. 129). See Dochev p. 254 and Raduchev &amp; Zhekov p. 113, however, for a coin struck from a re-engraved reverse die, 
where part of the name of Anna is visible.

The nephew of Mihail III Asen, Ivan Aleksander became emperor in 1331, following a coup which drove out the rightful though ineffective 
ruler, Ivan Stefan. The new ruler set about consolidating his position by regaining territories recently lost to the Byzantine Empire. In 1331, 
Ivan Aleksander campaigned around Adrianople and reconquered northeastern Thrace. After defeating the Byzantines at Rusokastro, a peace 
was struck, essentially reestablishing the status quo between the two powers, and an alliance was made with the betrothal of Ivan&apos;s eldest 
son, Michael Asen IV, to Andronicus&apos; daughter Maria (Eirene), the marriage eventually taking place in 1339. To safeguard his throne in the 
meantime, Ivan installed his eldest son, Michael Asen IV, as co-emperor in about 1332; he followed this up with the coronation of his younger 
sons, Ivan Sracimir and Ivan Asen IV, in 1337. It was possibly the intention of Ivan Aleksander that these younger co-emperors could establish 
immediate control over important cities and regions, and administer them directly. 

Throughout the 1340s, relations with the Byzantine Empire and Serbia were periodically strained. Attempts to repel the Ottomans repeatedly 
failed, and Ivan Aleksander&apos;s third son and co-emperor, Ivan Asen IV, was killed in battle against them in 1349, as also happened to his older 
brother Michael Asen IV in 1355 or a little earlier. A new and more successful attempt against the Ottomans was made in 1355, this time by 
John V Palaiologos. Although Ivan Aleksander&apos;s daughter Keraca Marija was married to the future Andronicus IV Palaiologos as part of the 
arrangement, the alliance failed to produce concrete results. 

To continue his policy of having sons as co-emperors and to replace those who had died, Ivan Aleksander divorced his first wife and married a 
second time. The sons of this new union were crowned as co-emperors, Ivan Šišman in about 1356 and Ivan Asen V by 1359. However, Ivan 
Aleksander&apos;s long-range plans had failed as the last surviving son from his first marriage, the co-emperor Ivan Sracimir, became effectively 
an independent ruler in 1356. 

In 1364, hostilities yet again broke out between the Bulgarians and Byzantines. Ivan Aleksander was forced to sue for peace. The relatively 
successful resolution of the crisis in the northwest did nothing to help recover the losses in the southeast. The Ottomans under Murad I 
conquered Adrianople and Plovdiv. Preparing to meet them, Ivan Aleksander died on 17 February 1371.

($200) 

Ivan Sracimir was the second son of Ivan Aleksander and was appointed co-emperor by his father Ivan Aleksander. At this or some later point, 
Ivan Sracimir was given control of Vidin, which he held for the rest of his reign. In 1365, he and his family became hostages of the Hungarians. 
Three years later, Sracimir was restored to his throne, but he had to acknowledge effective Hungarian overlordship. When Ivan Aleksander 
died in 1371, Ivan Sracimir was particularly determined to assert his independent status, and in 1381 he placed the metropolitan archbishop of 
Vidin under the control of the Patriarch of Constantinople, thereby effectively allying himself with the Byzantine Empire. 

After the Ottoman invasion of northern Bulgaria in 1388, Ivan Sracimir was forced to acknowledge Ottoman overlordship and accept Ottoman 
garrisons in his land. On the death of Ivan Šišman in 1395, Sracimir tried to control part of his brother&apos;s former realm which was not yet 
under Ottoman control, but was unsuccessful. When the Hungarians led a crusade against the Ottomans in 1396, Sracimir allied himself with 
it, placing his available resources at its disposal. The crusade ended in disaster at the battle of Nikopol on 25 September 1396. In 1397 Sultan 
Bayezid I captured Sracimir at Vidin and had him transported to Bursa, where he died. While part of the remaining realm stayed under the 
control of Sracimir&apos;s son and heir Konstantin II, independent rule of Bulgaria was effectively ended.

One of the sons of Ivan Aleksander and his second wife, Ivan Šišman was made co-emperor in 1356. After the death of his father in 1371, 
he succeeded to the central portion of Bulgaria with its capital Turnovo, while his brother, Ivan Sratsimir, held the territory around Vidin, 
and Dobrotitsa/Dobrotici of Dobrudja carved out Karvuna as an independent region. Shortly after Ivan Šišman came to the throne, the 
Ottomans compelled him to recognize them as overlords and send his sister Thamar (Kera Tamara) as a bride for Sultan Murat I. In spite of 
this arrangement, the Ottomans conquered more territory. Encouraged by the Serbian and Bosnian victory over the Ottomans at the Battle 
of Pločnik in 1387, Ivan Šišman attempted to break away from Turkish influence. The Ottoman reprisal was swift, and he was required to 
surrender another daughter, Drastar (Silistra), to the sultan. Though Ivan Šišman again tried to back out, Ottoman pressure forced him to 
comply, as well as surrender additional garrisons and other strategic fortresses. 

Following the Christian defeat at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, the Ottomans once again turned to Ivan Šišman. In 1393 the new sultan, 
Bayezid I, invaded Bulgaria and besieged Turnovo. After a three-month siege, the city fell on 17 July 1393, a date often taken as the end of the 
Second Bulgarian Empire, although both Ivan Šišman and Ivan Sratsimir survived. Ivan Šišman continued to rule in Nikopol as an Ottoman 
vassal, hoping for aid from the Hungarians, until he was beheaded there on the orders of Bayezid I on 3 June 1395. The remainder of Ivan 
Šišman&apos;s territory was annexed into the Ottoman Empire, although Šišman&apos;s son Konstantin II continued to rule at Vidin until 1422.

Dobrotitsa / Dobrotici was a Bulgarian noble, ruler of the de facto independent Principality of Karvuna and the Kaliakra fortress from 1366-
1386. In 1369 Dobrotitsa and Vladislav I of Wallachia helped Ivan Aleksander retake the town of Vidin from the Hungarians. In return, the 
emperor, needful of supporters, gave Dobrotitsa control of several coastal cities, including Varna. There, Dobrotitsa constructed a fleet, which 
he used to patrol the Black Sea. Although it was small, this fleet was very effective, and engaged the Genoese and Ottoman fleets successfully 
as far as Trebizond. At Dobrotitsa&apos;s death, he was briefly succeeded by his son, Ivanko Terter (1386-1387).

($1000) 

The Mih-Ho-Loong Fire Brigade was founded in 1866 as a private fire brigade serving the cosmopolitan city of Shanghai. It was apparently 
composed primarily of Westerners, with some native Chinese laborers. Following the Tientsin Massacre in 1870, the company petitioned to 
be organized as a military unit, and the parallel Mih-Ho-Loong Rifles was formed shortly thereafter. The later persisted through the Xinhai 
Revolution and into the 1930s. 

As with many Western organizations in Shanghai at the time, the Mih-Ho-Loong Fire Brigade also served an important social function: &quot;The 
first ball we attended in Shanghai was the prettiest I have ever been to. It was given by the Mih-Ho-Loongs -the Hook-and-Ladder Company 
of the Shanghai Volunteer Fire Brigade. &apos;Say the word and down comes your house&apos; is their motto, and at their annual ball they dance in their 
uniforms of scarlet and black, girt with leather. It is always considered one of the best balls of the season...&quot; (Helen F.M. Lewis, &quot;A Shanghai

With the foundation of the second Republic in 1848 came a need for new, Republican currency. The government invited a number of artists 
to submit designs for the new coinage. Numerous patterns were struck with types displaying a number of skilled portraits, making this an 
exciting area for the modern collector to explore.

Lautenthal, a town in the Harz Mountains of modern central Germany, was the site of a famous silver mine called &quot;Lautenthal&apos;s Luck.&quot; The 
town was founded in 1538 when iron ore was discovered in the area. After further exploration, the town developed into a successful silver 
mining operation. These multiple talers, which depict Lautenthal and its mine works in careful detail, reveal the mine&apos;s importance to the 
dukes of Brunswick as a source of great wealth. The young woman on the reverse, standing before a mountain valley scene, is likely an 
allegorical depiction of the goddess Fortuna. She plays a lute (&quot;Laute&quot; in German) in her role as the personification of the town of Lautenthal. 

The dukes of Brunswick probably minted these large coins to serve as an emergency fund when Lautenthal&apos;s rate of production was very 
high. Landowners in the duchy were required to purchase the talers according to their means. If the duke needed funding for a war or other 
emergency, he could ask for the coins to be returned. In exchange, the landowners would receive coins of lower silver purity.

Maué notes a medal of identical types dated 1631, but produced by Johann Kittel. Presumably, this refers to the present type, but as Kittel was 
born in 1656, he could not have been the engraver. We retain the suggestion proposed by Elsen of Samuel Kirchner.

Louis XII seized control of Milan early in 1499, ousting the ruling Sforzas. In 1508, under the leadership of Pope Julius II, the French joined 
with the Holy Roman Empire and Spain in the League of Cambrai against Venice. The alliance soon fell apart, however, due to the League&apos;s 
inability to follow up their successes and the Pope&apos;s growing distrust of the French. The Holy League was formed in 1510, an alliance of 
the Pope, Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, and England against Louis XII. The stunning French victory under Gaston de Foix at Ravenna in 
1512 was quickly overshadowed by his death during that battle. At the same time, the Swiss invasion of Milan compelled Louis to withdraw 
completely from his Italian interests.

Since no coins were issued in his name, the lead bullae of Hadrian IV are the only way to include Hadrian IV into a papal coin collection.

far-reaching papal act was the Donation of Ireland in 1156, granting Henry II of England dominion over Ireland.

Following the death of Mircea the Elder in 1418, control of Wallachia fell to Mircea&apos;s nephew, Mihail I, a member of the Danesti branch of the 
Basarab family. Mircea&apos;s illegitimate son Vlad was living at the time at the court of the Holy Roman Emperor, Sigismund. Vlad was surnamed 
Dracul, or Dragon, so-called because of his membership in the Ordo Draconis, or Order of the Dragon, a secret knighthood instituted by the 
Holy Roman Emperor to fight the Ottoman Empire. The symbol of the order was that of a dragon. 

Unable to succeed to the Wallachian throne because of his illegtimacy, in 1431 Sigismund appointed him governor of Transylvania. That same 
year his son, Vlad, was born. Though this boy would later acquire the epithet Tepes, or Impaler, because of his preferred method of torture, he 
is better known by his nickname Dracula, or &quot;son of the dragon,&quot; which became the inspiration for Bram Stoker&apos;s immortal vampire, Count 
Dracula. Discontent with being governor of Transylvania, Dracul was eager to claim the Wallachian throne for himself. After killing Mihail 
I, he became voivode of Wallachia in 1436, but his position was far from secure. He was a vassal of Hungary by oath, but also a tributary of 
the Ottomans as voivode. When the Turks invaded Transylvania in 1442, the Hungarian king accused his vassal of failing to properly defend 
the southern approaches to Transylvania, and forced Vlad out of Wallachia. In the meantime, the Hungarian general Janos Hunyadi installed 
another ruler in Vlad&apos;s absence. Vlad appealed to the Sultan for aid, which was granted, and Vlad regained the throne the following year. In 
return for the Ottoman aid, Vlad&apos;s younger sons, Vlad Dracula and Radu, were sent to the Sultan&apos;s court as hostages. Hostilities soon arose 
again between Hungary and the Ottomans, and Vlad was summoned to join the Hungarian side as a member of the Ordo Draconis. So as not 
to enrage the Turks and endanger his younger sons, Vlad sent his eldest son Mircea in his stead. The crusade failed and Vlad fell further out 
of favor with Hungary, which arranged his murder in 1447. 

The existence of Vlad II Dracul&apos;s coinage is known from a commercial charter dated to 1437, in which Vlad granted customs privilege to the 
merchants of Brasov. The charter mentions that both ducats and bani were struck by him. These coins were first published at the beginning 
of the 20th century, and the most recent paper dealing with the coinage of Vlad II Dracul recorded only seven specimens of this issue: six in 
public collections in Romania, and the seventh in the Fitzwilliam Museum (K. Parvan, &quot;Cateva consideratii privind activitatea monetara a lui 
Vlad Dracul -Considerations Regarding the Coin Minting Activity of Vlad II Dracul,&quot; Studii si Cercetari de Numismatica X [1993], p.101-7).

The Jonathan K. Kern Collection of Siege Coinage 

CNG is pleased to present the Jonathan K. Kern Collection of Siege Coinage. Comprising 119 coins, one 
remarkable and extremely rare medal, and an original Dutch edition of Gerard Van Loon&apos;s 1723 Beschryving 
der Nederlandsche historipenningen, this collection was lovingly assembled by Jon with an eye to acquiring 
examples of these emergency issues, struck during a tumultuous period in Europe&apos;s history. No stranger to the 
field, his broad numismatic knowledge has helped others in building their collections. At the same time, he has 
collected for himself coins that have a strong academic and historical appeal. 

As for Jon&apos;s numismatic backstory and reasons for collecting, no one could tell that story better than himself: 

In the early 1970s I was attending the University of Kentucky in the honors 
program as an undergraduate geology major. Coins were rapidly becoming 
much more fun than rocks. By working flea markets and coin shows on weekends, 
I came to the conclusion that I could earn $2,000 a year doing my hobby as a 
business, and I could survive on this income. Frugal living was acceptable to me 
if I could be my own boss. I dropped out of my second semester of my sophomore 
year to get married and do coins full time. I apprenticed under the expert coin 
repair master Paul Stockton for 3 months. We were mutually compensated since 
I was running his over the counter Pioneer Coin Shop for $1.00 an hour for his 
35 hour Monday thru Friday business week. 

The importance of a college degree could still not be overlooked and I probably knew that if I did not get a 
degree soon then it would never happen. I am very grateful that academia had entered the &quot;age of relevancy.&quot; 
The honors program offered tailored majors for a bachelor&apos;s degree if several criteria were met. All the course 
work for the usual Bachelor of Arts, Science or General Studies must be met. Courses related to the chosen major 
or independent course work at the junior and senior levels must be taken to meet the major requirements. Any 
independent work in the chosen major needed a faculty advisor capable of evaluating the quality of the study or 
research. 

So I went back for my junior and senior years and got my 
Bachelor of Arts with a major in Numismatics in June of 
1973. The normally offered courses I took in the College 
of Arts and Sciences related to numismatics included: art 
appreciation, economics, ancient, medieval and modern 
history, chemistry, geology, and radiochemistry. Eighty 
per cent of my independent study credits were devoted to 
my undergraduate thesis. My thesis was a thermal neutron 
activation analysis of silver coins from the Spanish Colonial 
mints Santa Fe de Bogota and Popayan in Colombia. Silver 
from the mining regions around these mints were largely a 
by product of gold mining activities. Refining materials were 
scarce and contemporary sources mention possible gold 
impurities in the silver coins. To verify these statements non-
destructively, I used a high thermal neutron flux generated by a 
Californium-252 source to make my sample coins radioactive 
for a short period of time. By identifying and measuring the 
radiation emitted by the coins, the gold impurities could be 
quantified. Many of the samples -½, 1, and 2 reales coins 
-had a 5% gold content, substantially raising the intrinsic 
value over face value. This could easily have contributed to 
the numismatic scarcity of the silver coins from these mints 
during this period. 

My chemistry professor, Dr. William Ehmann, evaluated the radiochemistry scholarship, and my history 
professor and honors advisor, Dr. John Scarborough, evaluated my numismatic research. I was fortunate that 
Dr. Scarborough was interested in the archaeological uses of numismatics and appreciated research into this 
specialized field.

In 1961 and 1962, my family lived in Bandung, Indonesia, on the island of Java. My father was teaching physics 
at the university as part of an academic exchange program. To paraphrase Neil Sowards, a missionary friend of 
mine who taught me a lot about foreign and ancient coins, &apos;the poor here wish they could be poor in the United 
States.&apos; The street peddlers would bring their varied local arts, crafts, foods, and miscellany around the academic 
neighborhood hoping to make a sale. I was immediately fascinated with the obsolete Dutch East Indies coin, 
which were for sale for a few cents each. Here were coins with holes in the middle, square coins (oriented like a 
baseball diamond), coins with scalloped edges, and cut bars of copper called bonks. Half cents, 2 ½ cents, 1/10 
gulden, ¼ gulden, ½,1, and 2 stuiver coppers, duits, 2 1/2 guilder and 3 guilder coins were all exciting to me. Here 
were coins with the Dutch language and Latin letters on one side but with Arabic script and Malay on the revese. 
Some of these were 200 years old! Some had portraits of a queen, shown in 4 different stages of life. And others 
were her father, and grandfather. So many different ways to collect coins! 

Arriving back in Lexington, I immediately joined the Bluegrass Coin Club, and was the only collector of foreign 
coins, and the only collector who didn&apos;t care about 1950-D nickels and 1909-S VDB Lincolns. I was excited when 
club member Brooking Gex sold me my first Dutch 20 guilder for $9 and gave me 3 months to pay. 

In the early 1970s, when I started doing New York city coin shows, I visited the American Numismatic Society. 
On display were cases of strangely shaped Dutch siege coins, focusing on the Protestant rebellion against the 
Catholic Spanish overlords known as the Eighty Years&apos; War. Fast forward 40 years and the Archer Huntington 
collection, which had been loaned to the ANS actually came up for sale! I had resources at the time, and as a 
collector I simply had to own them. Now in phased retirement, it is time to pass on the history and enjoyment of 
these many quirky emergency coinages that have given me so much pleasure. 

A Note from the Cataloger 

It has been both a pleasure and a challenge to catalog the Jonathan K. Kern Collection of Siege Coins. Covering 
a tumultuous period in the history of early modern Europe, with two centuries of almost continuous religious 
and political warfare, this collection reflects the importance of sieges in the warfare of this period and a tangible 
reminder of the human lives involved. Siege warfare can trace its historic origins to the earliest human settlements. 
During the Middle Ages, when cities became fortified citadels, military strategy focused on advancing through 
a territory and winning its objectives through a series of sieges. By the fourteenth century, when cannons were 
introduced, cities began to design more modern and complicated fortifications. The artist and polymath Leonardo 
da Vinci (1452-1519) spent a great deal of energy designing novel military technologies, which included designs 
for defensive fortifications. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, fortification design and siege tactics 
advanced rapidly in a kind of arms race. The result of all of this was that siege warfare remained a fundamental 
part of early modern warfare. 

As one can see from this collection, the European wars of the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries were often 
interwoven with one another, The largest number of coins here come from the Dutch Revolt (1568-1648). 
Having its beginnings in the nascent religious wars of the sixteenth century, it soon became a war of national 
survival. Even after the Dutch achieved their officially recognized independence with the Treaty of Westphalia, 
that independence still continued to be challenged, especially by Louis XIV. I found this section to be of special 
interest, for as a person of Dutch heritage. It is quite possible that some of my ancestors held these coins as they 
struggled to survive some of these sieges, or the battles that raged back and forth over the land. 

Please note that a number of these coins, especially those of the Dutch revolt are made of pewter, tin, and lead. 
Also, one issue of Amsterdam is engraved on the reverse with an image of Saint Barbara, the patron saint of 
artillerymen on the reverse. These pieces served as mementos, either to the men who served and survived, as may 
have been the case with the Saint Barbara issue, or to the subsequent generations who wished to remember the 
heroic deeds of their ancestors. 

Jon clearly enjoyed forming this collection -he can take pleasure in it being dispersed among new collectors who 
will be eager to learn their stories in more detail. For me, apart from the occasional missteps of other collectors or 
graders, this was a pleasure for me, and I hope to add one of these important coins to my collection. 

I thank Jeroen De Wilde for his assistance and personal notes, which contributed to this catalog. CNG thanks 
Numismatica Genevensis SA for the use of their images of those coins which have since been encapsulated.

The Ottoman wars in Europe were a series of military conflicts between the Ottoman Empire and various European states from the thirteenth 
century to World War I. The earliest of these wars were the Byzantine-Ottoman wars of the 13th century, followed by the Bulgarian-Ottoman 
wars, and the Serbian-Ottoman wars of the 14th century. This period saw extensive Ottoman expansion into the Balkans. In the 15th and 16th 
centuries, the Ottomans push further into Central Europe, culminating in the Siege of Vienna in 1529. 

The Ottoman-Venetian Wars lasted from 1423 to 1718. During this time, many formerly Venetian trading centers fell, including Negroponte 
in 1470, and Famagusta (Cyprus) in 1571. The defeat of the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the fall of Candia (Crete) in 1669, 
the Venetian reconquest of Morea (Peloponnese) in the 1680s, checked the Ottoman advance for a short while, but Morea&apos;s loss again in 1715 
left Corfu the only Greek island not conquered by the Ottomans. 

In the late seventeenth century, European powers began to consolidate against the Ottomans and formed the Holy League, reversing a number 
of Ottoman gains during the Great Turkish War of 1683-99. Nevertheless, Ottoman armies were able to hold off European armies until 
the second half of the eighteenth century. The Serbian (1804-1817) and Greek (1821-1832) insurrections demonstrated the weakening of 
Ottoman power in the Balkans. The final retreat of Ottoman rule came with the First Balkan War (1912-1913), followed by the World War I, 
which brought about the collapse of the empire as a whole. 

The siege of Vienna in 1529 was the first of two sieges by the Ottoman Turks against the city (the later coming in 1683). After a successful 
military campaign in Hungary, the Ottoman Sultan Sulayman I advanced on Vienna with an enormous force in the fall of 1529. However, due 
to poor weather and a strong defense of the city, he was soon forced to abandon the siege. This event was a high-water mark for the Turkish 
expansion. For more than a century afterwards, the Ottoman Empire would not have the power to threaten central Europe.

The Dutch Revolt (Dutch Nederlandse Opstand or Tachtjarige Oorlog [= Eighty Years War]) was one theater of conflict in the religious wars 
that took place during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. This period of warfare was the result of the Protestant Reformation. The Low 
Countries, which had been part of a personal union with the Hapsburg Holy Roman Emperor, became dissatisfied with the rule of the Spanish 
king, Philip II, who had received the territories from his father, Charles V, upon his retirement. Although Philip continued his father&apos;s policies, 
he was a less-than-popular figure among the people. He spoke no Dutch, unlike his father, who had been born in Ghent. Philip also appeared 
cold and distant, sending instead Spanish nobles to rule in his stead. Beginning in the summer of 1566, serious public disturbances broke out 
throughout the Low Countries. Known as the Beeldenstorm, or &quot;statue storm&quot;, these revolts were driven in the region by a famine resulting 
from a particularly harsh winter, Calvinist aversion to Catholic religious imagery, and the dissatisfaction of the local Dutch nobility with the 
increasingly Spanish-centered government. 

To make matters worse, Philip sent a large army under the Duke of Alba to crush the social unrest. Alba took a heavy-handed approach. 
He appointed a special court, known as the Raad van Beroerten (Council of Troubles). He bypassed the legally appointed Governor of the 
Netherlands, the King&apos;s half-sister, Margaret of Parma. He used her as a ruse to lure back the opposition leaders, the Counts of Egmont and 
Horne, who were then publically executed in Brussels in 1568. Willem van Oranje, known as de Zwijger (the Silent), who had originally 
been a favorite of the Hapsburg government, now became the de facto leader in exile of the revolt. His brother, Lodewijk van Nassau, tried 
to gain support from exiled Calvinists in England by sending ships across the Channel; instead these ships turned to privateering and became 
known as the Watergeuzen (&quot;Sea Beggars&quot;). And, in May 1568, Lodewijk, along with his (and Willem&apos;s) younger brother, Adolf van Nassau, 
defeated the Spanish army of Friesland at the Battle of Heligerlee. Even though this was a victory for the Dutch rebels, Willem&apos;s main problem 
continued to be acquiring foreign assistance for the Dutch cause. Because of Alba&apos;s harsh reprisals, known as the Spanish Fury, many hesitated 
or refused to help. Willem then turned to Protestant England and Catholic France. Both were obvious sources of aid, since each saw it as an 
opportunity to attack Spain by proxy. When the conflict broke out again in 1572 and Willem returned from exile, he set up his court in the 
Prinsenhof in Delft (since the Spanish occupied his ancestral lands of Orange at Breda). Here he remained until he was assassinated in 1584.

The Dutch Revolt 

Beginning with the capture of Den Briel in April 1572 by the Watergeuzen, most of the important cities in Zeeland and Holland sided with 
the rebels. Other cities, such as Amsterdam and Middelburg, remained loyal to the King and the Catholic cause. During this next phase of the 
conflict (1572-1585), the Low Countries was beset by repeated sieges of various cities by both sides. Because of the nature of the terrain there, 
with its numerous polders, dikes, wastelands and waterways, it was impossible for the Spanish to employ standard military tactics -large-
scale armies deployed on the field of battle. During the Middle Ages, Dutch cities, like others across Europe, had been encircled with thick 
outer walls interspersed with towers. With the invention of gunpowder and the cannon, new fortification technologies were devised (including 
the construction of projecting bastions), making these already fortified cities akin to impregnable citadels. 

Between 1573 and 1585 − a critical period in this second phase of the rebellion − the rebellion in the Low Countries divided along religious 
lines. Although the harsh Alba was replaced as the governor General of the Netherlands by the moderate and short-lived Luis de Requesens 
(who would die in early 1576), such moderation was to little avail as Alessandro Farnese, the Duke of Parma, succeeded Requesens. Farnese 
was the son of Ottavio Farnese, the second Duke of Parma, and Margaret, the illegitimate daughter of the Holy Roman emperor, Charles V. 
His mother&apos;s status in no way hindered her relations with her half-brother Philip II; in turn, Alessandro Farnese appears to have enjoyed a 
similar relationship with his uncle. In 1578, he was appointed Governor General of the Netherlands. A keen warrior who fought at the Battle 
of Lepanto in 1571, he had the opportunity to display his military skills against the Netherlandish rebels who had since revolted against Spain. 
As a result, Farnese was able to return the southern provinces to the Spanish throne, a process that was concluded with the Treaty of Arras on 
6 January 1579. 

In response to the Treaty of Arras, the seven Calvinist provinces of the North united under Willem in the Union of Utrecht on 23 January 1579. 
Thus, the once cohesive Low Countries were divided into a Southern Catholic portion, loyal to the Spanish king, and a rebellious Calvinist 
group to the north. To make matters worse, on 26 July 1581, the States General at the Hague signed the Plakkaat van Verlatinghe (Act of 
Abjuration), a formal declaration that those states under the Union of Utrecht were no longer bound in their loyalty to Philip II, who had 
forfeited his rights by failing his obligations and violating their ancient rights. Immediately after the signing of the Act, the Spanish sent a large 
army to recapture the rebellious northern provinces, now known as the United Provinces. Parma reconquered large portions of Flanders and 
Brabant, as well as large sections of the northeastern provinces. In 1585, the city of Antwerp was captured. Then the largest city in the Low 
Countries, almost half of its inhabitants fled north. Spanish success seemed assured when Willem van Oranje was assassinated the previous 
year by a Spanish operative at the Prinzenhof in Delft. 

Following the Plakkaat van Verlatinghe, the northern provinces directly offered the crown to the English and French monarchs. The youngest 
son of Henri II, François, the Duc d&apos;Anjou and Alençon was the first invited by Willem. A young man who supported the Protestants in his own 
country and was looking for his own territory to rule, the Duc d&apos;Anjou and Alençon accepted, assuming the title &quot;Protector of the Liberty of 
the Netherlands&quot;. After a delayed arrival (see his role in the Siege of Kamerijk), he was welcomed by a series of &quot;Joyous Entries&quot; into Brabant 
and Vlaanderen. Anjou was not a popular figure with the Dutch and the Flemish, who considered the Catholic French as enemies. Furthermore, 
his authority was limited. To compensate for this, Anjou decided to take direct control of several Flemish cities, including Antwerp. There, he 
attempted to take the city by trickery, but the citizen militia ambushed him and destroyed his troops in what was known as the &quot;French Fury.&quot; 
Barely escaping with his own life, Anjou died shortly thereafter of malaria. On the other hand, the English preferred to continue with indirect 
aid. Following the assassination of Willem van Oranje in 1584 and the signing of a treaty between the French Catholics and Spain to destroy 
the Huguenots, England was compelled to act in a more direct way. Under the terms of the Treaty of Nonesuch in 1585, Robert Dudley, First 
Earl of Leicester and Elizabeth&apos;s long-time favorite, was appointed Governor-General and sent with an English expeditionary force to support 
the Dutch in 1586. Dudley, however, publicly unpopular, proved to be a poor commander and within a year of his arrival returned to England, 
eventually to command the land troops preparing for an anticipated invasion of England by the Spanish as part of the Spanish Armada. 

Following the departure of the Earl of Leicester, the States General appointed Willem&apos;s son, Maurits van Oranje, as Captain General of the 
Dutch forces. From then until 1609, when the Twelve Years&apos; Truce was instituted, Maurits took advantage of Spanish attention elsewhere 
and the numerous mutinies of Spanish troops in the region to strengthen his position and expand his territories. In addition to Dutch ships 
assisting the English against the Spanish, Dutch forces laid siege to a number of fortified pro-Spanish border towns. At home in the heartland 
of Holland, the peace created by this period of Dutch advance helped to usher in the Gouden Eeuw, or Dutch Golden Age of trade and art. 
In 1609, the United Provinces and the Spanish-controlled southern provinces established a ceasefire. Mediated by the French and English, 
this period was known as the Twelve Years&apos; Truce (1609-1621). While both sides negotiated for a more permanent peace, the Dutch took 
advantage of the opportunity to strengthen their fleet to protect their sea trade, which had increased greatly with the establishment of the 
Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (Dutch East India Company) in 1602. When hostilities again broke out in 1621, it was Dutch shipping 
that provided the decisive factor. 

The final phase of the revolt (1621-1648) was due largely to irreconcilable demands for religious minorities in each of the two states. In 
addition, the Dutch trade interests conflicted with those of the Spanish, especially in the lucrative East Indies and the Americas, where the 
Dutch would establish a foothold on Manhattan in 1624. At this point, the revolt became a part of the larger Thirty Years&apos; War (1618-1648). 
During this period, Maurits died at the Siege of Breda (1625). In 1629, Maurits&apos; successor, his brother Frederik Hendrik van Oranjie, 
successfully captured &apos;s-Hertogenbosch, a serious blow to the Spanish, because it was considered to be impregnable. In 1632, Frederik began 
his &quot;March along the Meuse&quot; -a maneuver designed to conquer the cities of Vlaanderen. Overall, this strategy failed, due a lack of support 
by the Flemish, who now mistrusted the Calvinists more than the Spanish. The Dutch, however more successful on sea, raiding Spanish 
holdings in the Caribbean. The capture of a Spanish treasure fleet in the 1628 Battle in the Bay of Matanzas helped fund Frederik&apos;s siege 
of &apos;s-Hertogenbosch. Maarten Tromp&apos;s decisive defeat in 1639 of an Spanish armada containing 20,000 troops bound for Vlaanderen in a 
last-ditch large-scale attempt to reconquer the Republic at the Battle of the Downs effectively ended Spanish hopes for retaking the northern 
provinces, as well as ending forever Spanish dominance on the sea. The Dutch Revolt finally ended with the Treaty of Münster in 1648 as part 
of the Peace of Westphalia, which at last recognized the de jure independence of the Republic.

In the Dutch Revolt, Amsterdam initially refused to join Holland, Zeeland, and the southern provinces, all of whom wanted to push the Spanish 
from Dutch territory. In late 1577, the rebel Dutch forces blockaded the city. The blockade ended in February of 1578, when Amsterdam 
grudgingly agreed to join the rebellion against Spain. Soon after, the Catholic town council was replaced by Protestant members loyal to 
William, Prince of Orange, thus positioning Amsterdam as a participant in the Dutch struggle for independence. During the blockade, the city 
struck several denominations of silver siege coinage.

According to the hagiographies, Barbara was the daughter of a rich pagan named Dioscorus. To preserve her from the outside world, her 
father kept her locked in a tower. During this time, she secretly became a Christian. Dioscorus ordered that a bath house be built for Barbara 
while he was on a journey. Upon his return, Barbara proclaimed her faith, causing her father to draw his sword. Through Barbara&apos;s prayers, an 
opening magically appeared and she was transported to a distant province. There she was eventually captured and tortured by the local prefect. 
Holding true to her faith, she was repeatedly tortured, but every evening the wounds were miraculously healed. She was finally beheaded by 
her father, who was himself burned by lightning. 

Barbara was the patron saint of artillerymen, as well as armorers, military engineers, gunsmiths, tunnelers, miners, and anyone who worked 
with cannon and explosives. Siege pieces with post-event messages or engravings, like this coin, on their normally blank reverse, suggests 
that these coins were kept as a memento or souvenir by those who participated in the siege. Since the engraving here is the patroness of those 
involved in the active defense of the city, the owner may have had the engraving done as a devotional reminder of having survived the worst 
of the siege.

Breda, a town in the Spanish Netherlands, was one of the lands of William the Silent, Prince of Orange, a major figure in the struggle for Dutch 
independence in the Eighty Years&apos; War. Maurice of Nassau, William&apos;s son, was in command of the town when it was besieged in August of 
1624 by Spanish troops under Ambrosio Spinola. The well-defended town eventually fell to the Spanish in June of 1625. Not long after the 
fall of Breda, however, the tide of the war began to turn against Spain. The Dutch and their allies grew increasingly powerful, and in 1637, 
Prince Frederick Henry of Orange retook the city. In 1648, the Dutch United Provinces were officially declared independent of Spain in the 
Treaty of Münster. 

The Surrender of Breda, a painting by Diego Velásquez, vividly captures the end of the Spanish siege. The painting depicts the surrender of 
the Dutch by Justin of Nassau to the Spanish army. In his painting, Velásquez emphasizes the graciousness of the Spanish. He shows the two 
adversaries, Justin of Nassau and Ambrosio Spinola, meeting as if they are old friends. Spinola puts his hand on Justin&apos;s shoulder, preventing 
him from kneeling, as if to reassure him that he&apos;ll be treated with respect. The painting, completed ten years after this klippe was struck, is a 
fascinating depiction of the ideals of 17th century chivalry.

In late 1572, the Spanish, commanded by Fernando Álvarez, Duke of Alba, besieged Haarlem. With nearly 20,000 troops, the Spanish 
assumed an easy victory, considering Haarlem had only 6,000 armed men. However, their two attempted assaults (one in December and the 
next in January of 1573) met with overwhelming resistance and resulted in considerable losses. In an attempt to taunt the Spanish soldiers, 
the well-supplied townspeople occasionally threw bread over the city walls and mounted statues plundered from Catholic churches on the 
ramparts. In July 1573, the Spanish were finally able to break the town&apos;s supply line. With its food source gone, Haarlem was forced to 
surrender, thus ending the 10-month siege. The Spanish, hungry for vengeance, executed more than 1,700 of the town&apos;s citizens.

Following the departure of the Spanish on 17 August 1581, François, duc d&apos;Alençon, entered Kamerijk and, in a solemn ceremony, ordered 
a reinstatement of the city&apos;s privileges. According to Van Loon&apos;s discussion, following a blast of trumpets, a good number of gold and silver 
triangular medals were distributed among the crowd. Robert (Cambrai 1-7) lists seven types, some of which were in silver only, some only in 
gold, and others in both silver and gold. Although they have been known since the sixteenth century and are recorded in ancient collections, 
they remain extremely rare.

After much political wrangling, Willem was able to get the States-General to appoint the Duc d&apos;Anjou as Sovereign Prince and Lord of the 
Netherlands. By doing so, the Dutch hoped that France would intervene against the Dutch. Although Anjou did not openly declare war on 
the Spanish, he did provide the Dutch with assistance in the form of 17,000 men. This force was then deployed at Kamerijk, located in the 
territory of the Habsburg Netherlands (now part of modern France). Alessandro Farnese, the future Duke of Parma and Governor General of 
the Netherlands soon after laid siege to the city. For almost a year, the citizens and French soldiers suffered terrible privations until Parma, in 
mid August, was forced to break the siege with the arrival of the Duc d&apos;Anjou and his forces.

Kampen was a city that changed hands several times during the Dutch Revolt. Initially taken from the Spanish in 1572, it was voluntary 
surrendered to the Spanish following the massacre at Zutphen that November. In 1578, George van Lalaing, the commander of the siege at 
Deventer, retook the city once again from the Spanish.

Owing to ill-health of the Duke of Alba, Philip II, keen on prosecuting the war to recover his possessions in the Netherlands, appointed Luis 
de Zúñiga y Requesens to continue subduing the Dutch. One of the cities that had sided against the Spanish, Leiden was besieged by Resquens 
from November 1573 to July 1574. To break the siege, the Dutch cut the dikes, and thus enabled ships to carry provisions to the inhabitants 
of the flooded town. As a reward for the city&apos;s heroic defense, Willem van Oranje the following year granted them a university charter, from 
which the University of Leiden was established.

In 1559, William the Silent, Prince of Orange, was given the governorship of several Dutch provinces by the Spanish king Philip II. However, 
William&apos;s good relationship with the Spanish Habsburgs did not last long. William&apos;s frustration with the Spanish arose from several issues. He, 
along with many Catholic Dutch, was unhappy with the persecutions of non-Catholics. He also thought that the Spanish were undermining the 
influence of the native Dutch noblemen. Finally, taxation was a contentious issue; the rich merchants of the Netherlands were of the opinion 
that they were funding an unfairly large share of the Habsburgs&apos; costly wars. In response to these perceived injustices, William arose as a very 
popular supporter of the Dutch resistance, helping to form a confederacy dedicated to reducing Spain&apos;s power in the region. When Philip II 
discovered William&apos;s role in the rebellion, the Prince was stripped of his holdings in the Netherlands. In response, William raised an army and 
began attacking coastal towns held by the Spanish. In 1572, he besieged Middelburg, a town in the province of Zeeland. The city eventually 
surrendered in 1574 and was occupied. These events marked the opening phases of the Eighty Years&apos; War, a long struggle by the Dutch to 
gain independence from Spain.

The wealthy town of Oudenaarde became Protestant following the Reformation and allied itself with the city of Ghent against Charles V. The 
prolonged siege of 1582 resulted in the subsequent flight of merchants and nobles, resulting in the town to never recover to its former glory.

Culminating in the Oudewater Massacre (Dutch Oudewaterse moord), the siege of Oudewater demonstrates the brutality that often 
accompanied sieges. In 1568, a Spanish garrison was stationed at Oudewater. On 19 June 1572, a small Dutch force took the city and 
convinced its inhabitants to join the Dutch Revolt. Following his capture of Buren as part of the Spanish attempt to put down the Dutch Revolt, 
Gilles van Berlaymont besieged Oudewater for thirteen days. His capture of the town resulted in a bloodbath where many inhabitants were put 
to the sword, while many others set fire to their own houses to keep their possessions out of the hands of looting soldiers As much as half of 
the population may have perished in this event. Following Oudewater, van Berlaymont moved on to besiege Schoonhoven. 

The States of Holland and West Friesland in 1615 authorized an annuity to be paid to the survivors still living, a payment which continued 
until 1664 when the last survivor died. An annual commemoration of the massacre, which began in 1608, is held on the first Sunday, on or 
after 7 August.

On 28 June 1575, between 8,000 and 10,000 Spanish troops under the command of Gilles van Berlaymont, stadhouder for the Spanish 
crown, successfully captured the town of Buren; on 7 August the capture of Oudewater followed. The Spanish then turned their attention to 
the Protestant-held Catholic city of Schoonhoven. Assisted by its pro-Spanish mayors, Aart van Gerritse and Gerrit van Couwenhoven, who 
had been forced to flee, van Berlaymont was able to force the defenders, composed of French, Walloons, English, and Scots, to surrender 
after a thirteen-day siege. This garrison was then allowed to leave with its baggage and weapons. Among those who left with them were ten 
of Schoonhoven&apos;s citizens; the remainder received their Spanish liberators with great joy. Now, van Berlaymont moved next to Woerden.

After Schoonhoven, the Spanish under Gilles van Berlaymont next set siege to Woerden. Lasting almost a year, the Spanish withdrew without 
taking the town, because they were sent to deal with a mutiny in Flanders. The success of the defenders was due, in part, to the assistance 
of Adriaan van Swieten, who transported supplies to the town from nearby Gouda. In addition, the locals, more familiar with the terrain, 
used that knowledge to harry the Spanish. During this time occurred the Wonder van Worden, a legendary miracle, also known as &quot;the fish 
miracle.&quot; Faced with starvation, the citizens were saved by the miraculous appearance of large pike that entered the city via the Oude Rijn. 
A difficult fish, due to its nasty nature and sharp teeth, they complacently offered themselves to ithe populace for sustenance. This event is 
commemorated in a stained glass window in Woerden&apos;s Petruskerk.

Situated in Zeeland, Zierikzee, unlike it neighbor Middelburg, sided against the Spanish. Because of its strategic location and importance to 
the revolt, Zierikzee was besieged from November 1575 to February 1576. The city was eventually compelled to capitulate. In the ensuing 
negotiations, the Dutch were forced to allow those inhabitants of the city who were Catholic to enjoy religious freedom.

Taking place between 1592 and 1604, the Strasbourg Bishops&apos; War was a conflict between Protestants and Catholics for control of the 
Bishopric of the city. One of two sectarian wars that broke out within the Holy Roman Empire between the 1555 Peace of Augsburg and the 
outbreak of the Thirty Years&apos; War in 1618, it proved to be less bloody than the other sectarian war, the 1583-1588 Truchsessischer Krieg over 
control of Köln. Benefitting from the Peace of Augsburg, Straßburg enjoyed a larger amount of autonomy, status as an important trading 
center, and the site of a prestigious university. This university initially attracted radical thinkers of both religious sides. By the beginning of 
the war, both the University and the town were strongly Protestant. When the city&apos;s bishop, Johann von Manderscheid, died, Protestants, 
fearing that the Catholic Karl von Lothringen would stand for election as the new bishop (which he did), seized the episcopal offices and 
appointed fifteen-year-old Johann Georg, son of the Elector of Brandenburg, in the hopes that Protestant Germany would rally behind them. In 
addition, the Protestants acquired a loan of 300,000 florins from Friedrich I, Duke of Württemburg, to assist their cause. The Catholic prelates 
meanwhile fled to Saverne, and in exile, elected Karl as bishop. With the support of his younger brother Franz, Karl moved from Saverne to 
take Straßburg. Owing to the unwillingnes of the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolf II, to intervene, Henri IV, King of France -a Protestant who 
had converted to Catholicism -brokered a truce by dividing the bishopric between the contending prelates. Ultimately, Johann Georg passed 
the bishopric to Karl in return for Oberkirch, a German district that passed to the House of Württemburg 

The Thirty Years&apos; War 

Fought primarily in Central Europe between 1618 and 1648, The Thirty Years&apos; War was one of the longest and most destructive of the religious 
wars of the seventeenth century. Approximately eight million fatalities resulted from a combination of civilian violence, famine and plagues, 
as well as direct military engagements, including sieges. The majority of victims were inhabitants of the Holy Roman Empire, with the 
remainder being foreign mercenaries. So traumatic was this war that it still remains in the memory of the region&apos;s inhabitants, few of whose 
ancestors were not in some way affected. 

Beginning as a localized conflict between various Protestant and Catholic states in the fragmented Holy Roman Empire, the war developed 
into a broader conflict involving most of the great European powers. With these states utilizing large mercenary armies, the war became less 
religious in motivation and more of a rivalry for European political dominance. 

The election of Ferdinand II as Holy Roman Emperor provided the catalyst for the war. An ardent Catholic, he wanted to restore Roman 
Catholicism to the Imperial domains and suppress Protestantism. The northern Protestant states, angered by the violation of their rights 
to choose that had been granted to them in the 1555 Peace of Augsburg by Charles V, banded together to form the Protestant Union. As 
a result, the Protestant Bohemians revolted against their nominal ruler, Ferdinand II. After the so-called Defenestration of Prague, which 
violently deposed the Emperor&apos;s representatives there, both Protestants and Catholics prepared for all-out war. The Bohemians elected 
the Protestant Frederick V, Elector of the Rhine Palatinate as the new king of the Kingdom of Bohemia. The mainly Roman Catholic southern 
states, led by Bavaria, formed the Catholic League to expel Frederick in support of the Emperor. At the Battle of White Mountain, the emperor 
crushed the rebellious Bohemians and shortly after, executed its leading aristocrats. 

The universal Protestant condemnation of the Emperor&apos;s action at White Mountain escalated the war to a broader, more poltical, war. 
Following the events in Bohemia, Saxony threw its support to the Union. Sweden, then a rising military power, intervened in 1630 under its 
king Gustavus Adolphus, &quot;The Lion of the North,&quot; transforming what had initially been an imperial attempt to curb the Protestant states into 
a full-scale European war. His death at the Battle of Lützen in 1632 proved to be a serious blow for Protestant leadership. Spain, which had 
hoped to end the Dutch Revolt once and for all and crush the young Republic, intervened under the pretext of helping Austria. No longer 
able to tolerate the presence of Habsburg Spain and the Holy Roman Empire on its borders, Catholic France joined the Protestant side. Entire 
regions were devastated by famine and disease. Germany and Italy, Bohemia, and the Southern Netherlands all suffered from high death rates. 
Sieges occurred frequently as mercenaries and soldiers in fighting armies looted or extorted tribute for money. Finally, Europe, torn by this 
conflict, underwent a mania of witch burnings. 

Of all the European states, The Dutch Republic benefitted from the Thirty Years&apos; War. It was a time of great prosperity and development for 
the Republic. Known as the Gouden Eeuw, or Dutch Golden Age, the Dutch Republic became one of the world&apos;s foremost economic and naval 
powers. The Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, with additional treaties at Osnabrück and Münster, dramatically changed the political European 
landscape from a medieval to modern one. Borders of modern nation-states were emerging, the Bourbons in France were poised to dominate 
the second half of the seventeenth century under Louis XIV, Habsburg domination was on the down-swing, and Sweden emerged as a great 
power. This new balance of power set the stage for the great wars of the rest of the seventeenth and on into the eighteenth century.

When the last duke of Jülich-Kleves-Berg died in 1609, a controversy over his territory broke out. The Elector of Brandenburg and the Count 
of Neuburg entered an agreement in which they would split the territory between themselves. Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II was not happy 
with these terms. He sent Archduke Leopold V, his cousin, to serve as the administrator of the disputed duchy. Leopold set up his headquarters 
in the fortress at Jülich, which was handed over to him by Baron Johann von Reuschenberg. The fortress, now under the control of the Holy 
Roman Empire, was besieged in 1610 by a large force composed of nations hostile to the Habsburgs. This siege prompted Leopold and Johann 
von Reuschenberg to abandon Jülich. After the siege, the Count of Neuburg and Elector of Brandenburg put into effect their original plan to 
split the territory of Jülich-Kleves-Berg. They put the Dutchman Frederik Pithan in control of the fortress at Jülich. This, in effect, meant that 
the United Provinces controlled the fortress. In 1621, when the Dutch ceasefire with Spain expired, Spain invaded the United Provinces and 
besieged the Jülich fortress. After a costly siege, Spain took the fortress.

As one of the terms of the Peace of Westphalia, the town of Münster was to be ruled by a Catholic prince-bishop. Not long after the treaty 
was signed, the citizens of Münster rebelled against their ruler, Bishop Christoph Bernhard von Galen. Their goal was to raise Münster to 
the rank of an imperial free city, thus removing it from the influence of a local prince. In response, Bishop von Galen and his powerful army 
besieged the city, eventually putting down the insurrection and regaining control in March of 1661. This klippe is an emergency issue minted 
during the siege.

THE FRANCO-DUTCH WAR 

The Franco-Dutch War, sometimes called the Dutch War (1672-1678), was a conflict between the Dutch Republic and a coalition composed 
of France, Sweden, the Bishoprics of Münster and Köln (Cologne), and England. The lands of the Austrian Habsburgs, Brandenburg-Prussia, 
and Spain, later joined with the Dutch Republic to form the Quadruple Alliance. The first year of the war is often known as het Rampjaar 
(the Disaster Year), because a full-scale invasion by English, French, and German forces took the Dutch Republic completely by surprise. 

Following his defeat of the Fronde, and now king in his own right, Louis XIV (1643-1715), considering the Dutch to be economic rivals, 
seditious republicans, and Protestant heretics, began to prepare for war with the Dutch Republic. This was a slow process, since the two 
nations had been allies since the time of the Dutch Revolt. The Dutch signing of the Triple Alliance in 1668 with England and Sweden in 
support of Spain changed this arrangement since it checked French expansion in the Spanish Netherlands in the French War of Devolution 
(1667-1668). Carefully, Louis shifted the alliances of England and Sweden away from the Republic. Then, through a series of maneuvers, the 
French forces, along with an English expeditionary force, occupied the seven provinces.The Dutch public panicked and rioted. In the ensuing 
chaos, the brothers Johan and Cornelis de Witt, were seized and lynched by a mob, who believed that the brothers were involved in an attempt 
to assassinate William of Nassau (later William III of England). William was proclaimed stadhouder. France&apos;s promises to England stiffened 
Dutch resistance. The siege of Groningen then failed, and a series of Dutch naval victories under Admiral Michiel de Ruyter turned the tide 
toward the Dutch. 

At this same time, the Dutch were acquiring allies. Brandenburg-Prussia, the Holy Roman Emperor, and Charles II of Spain. In 1673, Louis 
turned away from the Dutch and turned to the Spanish Netherlands. At Maastricht, where Louis personally oversaw French operations, the 
commander of the musketeers, Charles d&apos;Artagnan, perished. Among the English delegation overseeing the battle was a young John Churchill, 
who would distinguish himself in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714), as the 1st Duke of Marlborough.. 

From 1676 through 1678, Louis&apos; main strategy was to undermine this new coalition. The marriage of Mary, the daughter of Charles II to 
William of Nassau, meant that now England would be on the side of the Dutch. Louis quickly tried to campaign before the English could 
re-enter the war against him. After victories at Ghent and Ypres, Louis gained considerable territory through the Treaty of Nijmegen, which 
ended the war in 1678.

The War of the Spanish Succession 

In 1701, a Grand Alliance against Louis was established. Consisting of England (after 1707, Great Britain), the Dutch Republic, and the 
Holy Roman Empire, their candidate was Charles, the son of Leopold I. By this point, however, the Empire was weakened by the increasing 
independence of German states within it. Now, Catholic Bavaria allied itself with France. 

William III, Louis&apos; chief rival, had died shortly after the war began. His sister-in-law Anne succeeded him. The new queen relied on John 
Churchill, the 1st Duke of Marlborough, as her commander. His victories at Blenheim, Ramilies, Oudenaard, and Malplaquet, sealed his 
reputation as a great general. By 1710, however, the situation was at a standstill. Churchill&apos;s victories in the Low Countries were offset by 
the Alliance&apos;s defeat in Spain. The war&apos;s cost made unpopular in Britain. The succession of the Alliance candidate to the throne of Austria 
made an Austro-Spanish union no better to Britain than the Franco-Spanish one that made them join the Alliance in the first place. Now, with 
the Tories in power, the administration of Robert Harley initiated peace talks with France and ceased active military participation, much to 
the consternation of Churchill and the Whigs. 

Without British support, the other Allies were forced to make peace. Under the treaties of Utrecht in 1713, and Rastatt and Baden in 1714, 
Phillip renounced his claim to the French throne and was confirmed as King of Spain. Spain retained its overseas possessions, while their 
European territories were divided between Austria, Britain, and Savoy. In the long run, Britain emerged as the leading European maritime and 
commercial power, bringing to an end almost a century of Dutch influence and the end of the Dutch Republic as a major power. The break-up 
of the Holy Roman Empire continued, paving the way for the creation of more powerful German states, most notably Prussia.

Humphrey Sutherland praised the restraint and foresight of the unknown master who designed this type, who &quot;in age when sumptuous 
decoration of all redundant space was the normal fashion, was content -and dared -to leave the field totally devoid of ornament within its 
encircling tressure. By this means he concentrated upon this larger and more personal portrait, so lifelike in its almost voluptuous forms, an 
emphasis which the Italian artists themselves were only just beginning to estimate and enjoy.&quot; Art In Coinage, p. 154.

In early 1631, the gold coinage was redesigned. A stylish new bust was introduced paired with a crowned oval shield of arms on the reverse. 
This change coincided with the increased involvement of the engraver Nicholas Briot in the mint. A concerted effort to improve the quality 
of production appears to have been undertaken in anticipation of Briot&apos;s first milled issue later that year. A series of beautiful proofs were 
struck. Some of the dies of these proof issues &apos;were subsequently released for general use and it is not surprising that in many cases they have 
produced coins with a superior finish and a rather smoother and more glossy surface than coins struck from the standard dies of the current 
issue.&apos; -Herbert Schneider, &quot;The Tower Gold of Charles I&quot; in BNJ 1956, p. 343.

The Battle of the Boyne (1 July 1690 O.S.) was the last battle between the forces under the personal command of the deposed James II of 
England and those of Dutch Prince William III and his wife, Mary II who had acceded to the crowns of England and Scotland. Taking place 
accross the River Boyne near the Irish town of Drogheda, the battle was a victory for William. Unable to regain the British crown, James was 
forced to flee to France following the battle. The symbolic importance of this battle has made it one of the best known battles in the history of 
the British Isles and a key element in the folklore of the Protestant fraternal organization, the Orange Order.

SCOTLAND. James VIII. Pretender, 1688-1766. Pattern AR Guinea (26mm, 7.34 g, 6h). Dies by J. Roettiers. 
Dated 1716 (Struck 1828 by Matthew Young). Laureate and draped bust right / Crowned cruciform coats-of-arms with thistle 
at center; scepters in angles. Burns 2; Woolf 33.2; Dundee 347; SCBC 5725. Superb EF, attractively toned, a few minor 
planchet flaws on obverse. 
($1500) 

Although the dies were engraved in 1716 by Roettiers, no specimens are known to have been struck at that time. All extant examples were 
struck by the celebrated coin dealer Matthew Young in 1828. Young presented the dies to the British Museum in 1829. 

James VIII became the heir to the Jacobite cause on the death of his father, the ousted James VII (II). Known today as the Old Pretender, James 
was recognized as the rightful king of England and Scotland by France, Spain, and the Papal states. Two campaigns attempted to return him 
to the throne: a landing near the Firth of Forth in 1708, was blocked by the arrival of the British navy, and a failed uprising of the clans in the 
north of Scotland in 1715. On his return from the second attempt James found himself unwelcome in France, and the Old Pretender lived out 
the rest of his days in exile in Rome.

Coins in the name of Thymn are enigmatic. Although it is tempting to ascribe them to one of the many issues with blundered inscriptions, the 
consistency of this legend across many dies assures us that the inscription is intentional. Earlier numismatists attributed them to a &apos;Donald, 
king of Monaghan,&apos; but as there is no evidence of any such historical king, this identification has been dropped. Some have also ascribed the 
coins to a Norse rival of Sihtrics, but this is also unsupported by other evidence (E. Colgan, For Want of Good Money, the story of Ireland&apos;s 
coinage [Wordwell, 2003], p. 5). Nonetheless, hoard evidence (esp. Igelösa and List) place these issues in the later part of Phase I (see M. 
Blackburn, &apos;Presidential Address. Currency under the Vikings. Part 4. The Dublin Coinage c. 995-c. 1050,&quot; BNJ 78 [2008], pp. 131-2).

Following the increase in racial and religious discrimination against the native Irish population during the first third of the seventeenth century, 
an open rebellion exploded in October 1641, when two Protestant members of the Lord Justices of Ireland prevented the Irish Parliament from 
passing a bill to alleviate Catholic grievances. While the rebels failed to seize Dublin Castle, which was one of their initial objectives, they 
quickly found success in Ulster province, from where the rebellion spread to the countryside. Following the outbreak of civil war between 
Charles I and the English Parliament the next year in 1642, the Irish Catholic rebels gave their support to the King, further placing them at 
odds with the English Protestants. 

Several emergency issues of coinage were struck during the early years of this rebellion. Among them was this crown, part of an issue 
commonly known as &quot;Ormond&quot; money, because it was erroneously believed to have been struck by James Butler, Marquis of Ormond, who 
led the Royalist forces in Ireland and was appointed Lord Lieutenant by Charles in November 1643. More accurately, this issue (like the so-
called &quot;Inchiquin Money&quot;) was struck by the Lord Justices, who served as the royal executive in Ireland.
