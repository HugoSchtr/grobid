To participate in this sale electronically you must be registered and approved to bid on www.cngcoins.com. 

Please read the auction terms for new information regarding bidding, buyer&apos;s fees, and payment of invoices. 

This is an internet and mail bid sale with an automated electronic close, con-
ducted by Classical Numismatic Group, Inc. (CNG). Bidding in the auction 
constitutes acceptance of the following terms: 

1. The property listed in this catalogue is offered for sale by CNG for itself 
and as agent for various owners and other consignors. We reserve the right 
to reject any bid, to determine the opening price, to set bidding increments, 
to vary the order of the auction, to reopen bidding in the case of a dispute, to 
withdraw any lot, to bid on behalf of CNG, to bid on behalf of the consignor, 
and to permit the consignor to bid on his own lots. CNG may loan or advance 
money to consignors or prospective bidders, and may have an interest other 
than commission charges in any lot. CNG may bid on its own account as an 
&quot;insider&quot; with information not available to the public. 

2. Lots will be sold in the order listed in the catalogue. The first lot will 
close electronically at www.cngcoins.com at 10AM Eastern Time on the 
sale date, with subsequent lots closing every 20 seconds thereafter. All 
written, fax, email and phone bids must be received by 5PM Eastern Time, on 
the day prior to the sale date. Electronic bids may be placed by approved bid-
ders up until the closing time of each lot. The electronic clock on the website 
represents the official closing time for each lot. Bidders intending to bid elec-
tronically must first register at www.cngcoins.com. New website registrations 
are processed for approval Monday through Friday 9AM-5PM Eastern Time 
only. No new registrations will be approved on the sale date. 

3. A 21% Buyer&apos;s Fee will be added to the hammer price of all successful 
written, fax, email and phone bids. A 19% Buyer&apos;s Fee will be added to the 
hammer price of all successful electronic bids directly placed on www.cng-
coins.com. 

4. All coins are guaranteed genuine. Attribution, date, condition and other 
descriptions are the opinion of the cataloguer, and no warranty is expressed 
or implied. Please note that an auction sale is not an approval sale. Lots 
examined prior to the sale and lots purchased by floor bidders (including bid-
ders executing commission bids on behalf of other parties) may not be returned 
for any reason except lack of authenticity. All claims of misdescription and all 
claims of return, except claims regarding authenticity, must be made within 5 
days of receipt of material. Any claim of lack of authenticity must be made 
in writing by the original purchaser immediately after discovery that an item 
is not authentic, and upon making such a claim the original purchaser must 
immediately return the lot to CNG in the same condition as at the time of the 
auction. Coins that have been encapsulated (&quot;slabbed&quot;) by a grading and/or 
authentication service may not be returned for any reason, including authen-
ticity, if they have been removed from the encapsulation (&quot;slab&quot;). If payment 
is made by credit card, rights of return are governed by these Auction Terms 
which supercede any rights of return promulgated by the card issuer. Estimates 
are intended as a guide only and not as a statement of opinion of value. 

5. Invoices are due and payable immediately upon receipt. Interest and late 
fees of 2.0% per month, or at the highest rate permitted by law, whichever 
is less, from the date of the auction, shall be payable on invoices not settled 
within 30 days of the auction date. Payment may be made by check or bank 
wire. Credit cards (Visa or MasterCard) will be accepted; credit card payments 
will not be accepted more than 14 days after the sale date. Payment by check 
must be made in either US dollars ($) drawn on a US bank or British sterling 
(£) drawn on a British bank. All successful bidders outside North America and 
the United Kingdom will be charged an additional $20 fee for bank charges 
that are the result of international wire transfer fees; this fee will be deducted 
for credit card or check payment as described above. CNG may reduce or 
compromise any charge or fee at its discretion. 

6. Bidders not known to us must provide satisfactory credit references or 
pay a deposit as determined at CNG&apos;s discretion before bidding. Minors are 
not permitted to bid without written consent of a parent guaranteeing payment. 
CNG may require payment in full from any bidder prior to delivery of lots. 
Title does not pass until lots are paid in full. Upon receipt of lots, the buyer 
assumes full responsibility for loss or damage. Delivery to the buyer&apos;s address 
of record shall constitute receipt by the buyer regardless of the identity of the 
person accepting delivery. 

7. Estimates are in U.S. dollars ($) and bids must be made in even dollar 
($) amounts. The CNG website, www.cngcoins.com, will execute electronic 
bids on behalf of all electronic bidders. Subject to reserves and opening prices, 
all electronic bids will be executed by the electronic software at one bidding 
increment (approximately 10%) over the next highest bid. All written, fax, 
email and phone bids received before 5PM the day prior to the sale date will be 
uploaded to the CNG website no later than the day prior to the sale date. These 
bids will not be subject to the minimum required bid cited on the website at 
the time of the upload. Any written, fax, email and phone bids received after 
the deadline or with special instructions will be executed at CNG&apos;s complete 
discretion and will be subject to the next bid required by the website. In the 
case of identical written, fax, email and phone bids, the earliest bid received 
wins. An electronic bid has priority over any identical written, fax, email or 
phone bid. Bid by lot number. No lot will be broken. Bidders are responsible 
for errors in bidding. Check your bids carefully. Electronic bidders may check 
their bids under User Services at www.cngcoins.com. 

8. A word on Reserves. CNG may place a reserve on any lot. However, no 
reserve will be higher than the estimate, and ordinarily lots are reserved at 60% 
of estimate. 

9. Bidders personally guarantee payment for their successful bids, including 
bidders executing commission bids from other parties and bidders representing 
corporations or other entities. Buyers accepting commission bids from other 
parties do so at their own risk and remain responsible for payment under these 
Auction Terms. 

10. In the event a successful bidder fails to make full payment within 30 
days of the auction date, CNG reserves the right to deem the sale incomplete 
and to resell the material, and the bidder agrees to pay for the reasonable cost 
of such a sale and also to pay any difference between the resale price and the 
previously successful bid. CNG reserves all rights that it is entitled to under 
the Pennsylvania Uniform Commercial Code, including the right to offset any 
sums due from a successful bidder against any future consignment or purchase 
or monies or goods in possession of CNG. 

11. Sales tax, postage, handling and insurance are the responsibility of the 
buyer and are added to all invoices where appropriate. For buyers in the 
European Union, CNG may import lots into the United Kingdom prior to 
shipment and charge buyers the import Value Added Tax. On any tax not paid 
by the purchaser which should have been paid, even if not invoiced by CNG, 
the purchaser agrees to pay the same on demand together with any interest or 
penalty that may be assessed. It is the responsibility of the buyer to comply 
with foreign customs and other regulations. 

12. Prices realized are published and are mailed with CNG&apos;s next publica-
tion. Prices realized are posted at www.cngcoins.com and successful electronic 
bidders are notified by email after the last lot of the sale closes. 

13. Bidders hereby waive any claim for incidental, consequential or exem-
plary damages arising from this auction. The sole remedy that any participant 
in the auction shall have for any claim or controversy arising out of the auction 
shall be a refund, without interest, of all or part of the purchase price paid by 
the participant. 

14. All rights granted by CNG or otherwise available to bidders and pur-
chasers, under these Auction Terms or otherwise, are personal and may not 
be assigned or transferred to any other person or entity, whether by operation 
of law or otherwise. No third party may rely on any benefit or right conferred 
by these Auction Terms. Bidders acting as agents must disclose the agency in 
writing to CNG prior to the auction; otherwise rights are limited to the agent 
and are not transferable to the undisclosed principal. 

15. Any dispute regarding this auction shall be governed by the laws of 
Pennsylvania and shall be adjudicated only by the Lancaster County Court 
of Common Pleas or the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of 
Pennsylvania; all bidders submit themselves to the personal jurisdiction of 
these courts for this purpose, consent to service of process by registered or 
certified mail, and waive any contrary provisions of Articles 14 or 15 of the 
French Civil Code and any similar provisions in any jurisdiction. All bidders 
consent to the confidentiality of consignors&apos; identities and waive any right to 
require disclosure of the name of the consignor or owner of any auction lot, 
whether such right is based on New York GOL  §5-701(a) or any other provi-
sion in any jurisdiction. In any dispute regarding this auction, the prevailing

<preface>A COLLECTION OF ROMAN AND SELECT PROVINCIAL MINT COIN 
DENOMINATIONS FROM THE FIRST CENTURY BC TO THE ADVENT 
OF THE EASTERN ROMAN EMPIRE IN THE FIFTH CENTURY AD 

By Douglas O. Rosenberg 

After over 40 years of studying and collecting Roman sestertii, my horizons widened with the recognition that a variety of 
denominations came into being and/or changed in significant ways throughout my period of interest. These coins were also 
necessary to enable citizens, soldiers and slaves to engage in commerce and fulfill their daily needs, desires and dreams! After 
parting with most of my sestertii, I began assembling the coins that would give me the most complete scope and variety of 
denominations commonly available to most Romans. 

A close review of the major catalogues indicated that I had missed several denominations in compiling my corpus, so I have 
had to add such items as a post-reform radiate, half follis, quarter follis, eighth follis, half centenionalis, and billon argenteus 
to my acquisition list as well as a half siliqua, gold 1 ½ scripulum, silver sestertius, base metal quinarius and a gold binio or 
double aureus to ensure completeness in the scope of the collection. Alas, it took until 2012 to obtain the silver sestertius 
and then recognize the need for an orichalcum (or brass) sestertius first issued by Augustus, to fully represent the diversity of 
metals employed by the Roman State in providing a full range of circulating media of exchange for use by the public at large. 
In late January 2016, I finally got a brass (orichalcum) sestertius of the moneyer &quot; C. Gallius Lupercus&quot; minted in 16 BC to 
complete my set. 

I have completed a quest that began over 40 years ago, but was not recognized as such until my level of study, refinement of 
aspirations, and amassing of specimens reached a critical mass such that the logical end point became apparent. In all, the 
denomination and representative colonial mint collection I have assembled numbers 75 pieces. (Note: 41 individual lots from 
the Rosenberg Denomination Set are included in Auction 105, with the balance of the collection appearing in the concurrent 
Electronic Auction 397, closing on May 17th). 

An examination of Roman coinage extant from the 1st century BC to the 5th century AD reveals some interesting facts and 
trends. The first significant change was the replacement of the tiny silver sestertius by the large orichalcum version at the end 
of the 1st century BC. The serrate version of the denarius was not retained after mid-first century BC, and the rationale for its 
striking remains obscure. 

Revaluation of the copper As at 16 to the silver denarius from 10 led to a major diminution in weight for the coin, and an As 
of 9 to 12 grams of copper became a standard that lasted until well into the 3rd century. Nero was the first ruler after Augustus 
to formally reduce the weight and fineness of precious metal coinage. 

Caracalla, in AD 214, created the antoninianus, a radiate head silver coin tariffed at two denarii, but lacking that ideal in 
both weight and fineness. Trajan Decius created the double sestertius in brass (also radiate headed) and the denomination 
was maintained by several of his successors. Aurelian reformed the (mostly copper) antoniniani at a later period, and issued 
coins containing 5% silver in their stead. Improvements in the other denominations were also undertaken. Then, circa AD 
294, Diocletian inaugurated changes in the monetary system that led to a fundamental restructuring of the circulating coinage 
medium. 

A summary of Roman coin denominations divides into two major sections: pre-and post-Diocletianic. 

Pre-Diocletianic coinage consists of three gold denominations: binio, aureus, and quinarius; the silver coinage is comprised 
of cistophoric tetradrachms, antoniniani, denarii, and quinarii; brass coinage includes double sestertii, sestertii, dupondii, and 
semisses; copper coinage consists of the as, quadrans, and the uncia; and the billon coinage is made up of silver or brass coins 
mixed with cheaper copper or lead ores. 

Post-Diocletianic coinage is comprised of four gold examples: solidus, semissis, 1 ½ scripulum and tremissis; the silver 
coinage consists of the argenteus and half argenteus, and in a final evolution, the heavy and light miliaresion, heavy and 
light siliqua, third siliqua and half siliqua; for the billon coinage we have the argenteus, follis, half follis, third follis, quarter 
follis, and eighth follis; for bronze coinage we have the double centenionalis, centenionalis, half centenionalis, and quarter 
centenionalis (commonly known as AE-1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s). Toward the end of the fifth century, silver was totally removed from 
the smallest coin and its final iteration was as a tiny, totally copper example known as a &apos;minimus&apos;. 

Colonial mints produced coins in a plethora of metals and denominations, many of which did not exist in the purely Roman 
system. The partial selection represented in this collection include: billon and potin tetradrachms of Alexandria (Nero &amp; 
Domitius Domitianus); a brass semis of Samosata (Vespasian); a bronze didrachm of Rhodes (circa Trajanic era-see lot 578); 
a silver tetradrachm from Laodicea ad Mare (Septimius Severus-see lot 590); a sestertius from Antioch in Pisidia (Gordian 
III); and a pale electrum stater (Severus Alexander &amp; Kotys III). Other denominations that may be encountered by diligent 
collectors include silver tridrachms, didrachms, drachms, and hemidrachms. In bronze or copper, assaria are extant in various 
sizes representing1, 3, 5, 10, and 11 by their size and weight. 


6 

Although most of the specimens in this collection grade VF or better, the few lower grade examples illustrate important factors 
in the circulation of coinage in imperial times. Two examples should suffice. First, the worn AE semis of Trajan Decius implies 
a circulation pattern of about fifty years before being put aside. The only generally circulating AE coin in about AD 300 was 
a post reform radiate-not at all resembling the laureate head on the semis! My second example is the AE-4 of Valentinian III. 
This coin is worn down by virtue of not being minted in adequate numbers, thus scarcity providing the rationale for an over-
reliance on an inadequate supply of circulating medium that quickly led to problems for commerce and inhibited transactions 
from occurring using specie in payment. 

In summary, throughout Roman times a persistent devaluation of the coinage is apparent when identical denominations are 
compared over a sufficiently long period of time. These changes resulted from several causes: weight reduction per se, relative 
change in the percentage of precious metals employed, re-tariffing of denominations relative to the market basket of goods 
purchased, and finally, replacement of circulating medium by a coinage standard utilizing inferior product throughout the 
range of replacement denominations. 

Among the specimens acquired are several that have special meaning for me. First, the silver sestertius (see lot 713), which 
was unknown to me for years until the publication of David Sear&apos;s Millennium Edition of Roman Coins and Their Values. 
Similarly, the existence of double aurei (binios), 1 ½ scripulae, commemorative third siliquae, and eighth folles somewhat 
surprised me after collecting for almost fifty years! The acquisition of a billon tetradrachm of Domitius Domitianus (see lot 
646) led me to write an article for The Celator about this ephemeral usurper amid the reign of Diocletian. 

Portraiture, as expressions of what these people looked like and how they wished to be publically represented, has always 
fascinated me. The ever youthful Augustus portrayed on the cistophoric tetradrachm (see lot 799), the stern visage of Galba on 
the dupondius (see lot 836), the well-fed and dissolute Vitellius with goiter on his neck clearly shown on the dupondius (see lot 
842), and the careworn features of Gallienus on the gold binio (see lot 948), who was facing breakaway provinces, usurpers, 
and invasion of Roman lands on all sides. 

In conclusion, the rarity of some denominational examples requires comment. Over 15% of the coins in this collection rate 
an R2, R3, R4, or &apos;uncatalogued as yet&apos; designation from RIC. The half siliqua of Gratian is an R4 (see lot 993), and my most 
difficult to obtain specimen! The Maximianus eighth follis is also an R4 (see lot 958), the Constantine I half siliqua is an R3 
(see lot 969), and the binio of Gallienus (see lot 948) is uncatalogued as yet (although represented by a few examples in the 
aureus denomination with the identical reverse). Gold and silver multiples exist, predominantly from the reign of Tacitus (AD 
276) onward almost to the end of the empire in the west. These anomalous specimens represent gifts to important military 
leaders and high-ranking officials in the government, and did not ever play a role in the normal commerce of the time. 
Accordingly, they were not included in the scope of this collection. The final numismatic category not chosen for inclusion was 
that of medallions. A great number of bimetallic, and brass or copper examples exist, which commemorate a host of occasions, 
but since they never formed a component part of the circulating coinage they have not received further consideration.

Demonstrating the usual flare shown by the die engravers in the service of Pyrrhos during his military expedition in Italy and Sicily, the 
small gold issues of 280/279 BC depicting Nike and Leukippos (HN Italy 1629-1631) are of a refinement second to none. The traditional city 
founder is rendered in exquisite detail with the added novelty of his helmet being decorated with Skylla hurling a stone, the very embodiment 
of aggressive violence before the enemy in time of war.

Tudeer places this die combination among the issues either signed by, or in the style of, Parmenides. Indeed, the obverse die here is linked to a 
reverse signed by Parmenides (Tudeer 77, see next lot). However, the style of the Parmenides-signed reverses is quite different from the style 
of this die. In particular, Arethousa is always depicted with a triple-pendant earring, and one of the dolphins is emanating from the truncation 
of Arethousa&apos;s neck. The hoop earring and general style of Arethousa on the present die are most similar to the work of Eukleidas (see, e.g., 
Kreutzer pl. II).

THRACE, Ainos. Circa 453/2-451/0 BC. AR Tetradrachm (24mm, 16.45 g, 8h). Antiadas, magistrate. Head of 
Hermes right, wearing petasos with pelleted rim and inscribed Å5@5 / Goat standing right in linear square; Å@t-5ÅdÅs 
around; to right, Pan standing right on base, cradling lagobolon in right arm and raising left hand; all within incuse square.

IV 1498, pl. 344, 15 (same obv. die). Good VF, toned, minor porosity. Well centered and struck. 
($5000) 

Ex Roma IX (22 March 2015), lot 240. 

As noted by May, the tetradrachms of his Group XVI are &quot;unique among the coinage of Ainos,&quot; in that the ethnic was moved from the 
reverse and placed on Hermes&apos; petasos, while the goat was framed by a linear square around which was placed the name of Antiadas and the 
figure of Pan. Both the placement of the ethnic on the obverse and the addition of a magistrate&apos;s name and symbol to the reverse are unlike 
all the other silver tetradrachms of Ainos, before and after, and these innovations were probably influenced by similar tetradrachms issued 
contemporaneously at the mints of Abdera and Maroneia. It is uncertain why these innovations were not continued in the subsequent series, 
but perhaps the answer lies in the lengthy pause between the end of the present series, circa 451/0 BC, and the beginning of the subsequent 
one, circa 435/4 BC. May&apos;s Group XVI coinage is also the only instance where a magistrate&apos;s name is found on the coins of Ainos, and this 
series is arguably the most intricate of all the profile bust tetradrachm series issued there in the early-mid 5th century.

THRACO-MACEDONIAN TRIBES, Uncertain. Circa 500-480 BC. AR Stater (20mm, 9.46 g). Centaur right, 
carrying off protesting nymph / Quadripartite incuse square with swastika pattern. Asyut 62-80; HPM pl. VI, 15 and 17-18; 
AMNG III/2, pl. XXV, 10; SNG ANS 980 (Orreskioi). Good VF, minor porosity. 
($3000) 

The centaur-nymph motif was used by a number of Thraco-Macedonian tribes, and at least three tribes -the Orreskioi, Letaioi, and the Zaelioi 
-inscribed their ethnic on the obverse. The present coin, though, belongs to the quantity of unsigned issues which cannot yet be assigned to 
a particular tribe, although the cataloger of the ANS sylloge assumed the issue was from the Orreskioi. Moreover, the obverse on this coin 
has a pellet border, which is not present on any of the signed issues. This type also was declared a forgery by Gaebler in AMNG, along with 
many other Thraco-Macedonian issues, but his views on these were never adopted by other numismatists, and later hoards have proven his 
condemnations to be unfounded.

In his 1988 article on Rhodian imitations, R. Ashton has argued persuasively that this coinage was struck by Perseus to pay Cretan mercenaries 
serving in his army (see &quot;A Series of Pseudo-Rhodian Drachms from Mainland Greece,&quot; NC 1988, pp. 29-30). The Rhodian coinage circulated 
on Crete, where it was a familiar and trusted currency for the Cretans, and it is likely that they would have required payment in that form (see 
also R. Ashton, SM 146 [May 1987], p. 34).

Founded in the fifth century BC, the Akarnanian Confederacy was composed from time to time of a varying number of the local towns. In 
438 BC, the Confederacy allied itself with Athens, providing it with support during the Peloponnesian War, while at the same time expanding 
its own control in the region. During this period, the Confederacy began to issue coinage, which, like the coins of many of the other Greek 
confederacies, were struck in the city-states of its leading members. The obverse of this federal coinage depicts the head of the river-god 
Achelöos, the eponymous patron of the river which formed the natural boundary between Akarnania and Aitolia. The reverse may depict 
Apollo Aktiakos, whose temple was located on the promontory overlooking the Gulf of Ambrakia and which may have served as the meeting 
place of the confederacy&apos;s members. 

During the fourth century BC, the Confederacy shifted its alliances between Sparta and Athens as they struggled to control Greece. By the 
latter part of the century, however, the Akarnanian Confederacy was allied with Macedon. In 314 BC, it sided with Kassander in the Diadoch 
Wars. Periodic border conflicts with the Aitolians resulted in the loss of Akarnanian border territories and, although an agreement was reached 
in 263/2 BC, by 250 BC, at about the same time this quarter stater was minted, the Akarnanian Confederacy was divided between the Aitolians 
and the Molossians in Epeiros. In 230 BC, the Akarnanian Confederacy enjoyed a brief revival, but after the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC, 
information about it disappears from the historical record.

Approximately fourteen Delphi tridrachms are known; this is one of only two with the dolphins arranged in a circular manner 
on the reverse. 
($50,000) 

From the Ghazzat/Gaza 1960s hoard. 

The Ghazzat Hoard was found in the sea off the coast of Gaza in the 1960s. The coins from the hoard have been consigned by the Tarazi 
family, who acquired the coins immediately after they were found. In recognition of the importance of the hoard for scholars, the Tarazi family 
offered 27 of the hoard&apos;s 29 coins as a single lot in Triton XIX (lot 82). The present Delphi tridrachm was retained by the family. 

The tridrachms of Delphi are among the most historically interesting of all Greek coins. Prior to the Asyut find they were only known from 
two coins in Paris and Berlin, as well as a fragment from the Zagazig Hoard of 1901 (IGCH 1645); now there are at least 14 examples. The 
obverse type is a direct reference to the Greek victory over the Persians at Plataea in 479, when a great deal of booty, including silver vessels, 
was taken by the Greeks. These two rhyta were certainly from that booty and must have been brought as a dedication to Apollo in Delphi 
(rams were sacred to Apollo, along with dolphins). The reverse of this coin is also very unusual: it is not a normal quadripartite incuse but, 
rather, clearly shows the stepped coffering that we know decorated ancient ceilings, especially those of prestigious buildings like the Temple 
of Apollo. The dolphins that ornament these coffers are a reference to both the name of Delphi and to the fact that Apollo himself could appear 
in the form of a Dolphin.

Near EF, toned. Well centered, attractive early style. 
($1500) 

The particular style of the palmette on Athena&apos;s helmet, and the narrow, deep incuse of the reverse suggests that this coin was among the 
earliest issues in the ubiquitous &quot;frontal eye&quot;/classical tetradrachms of the mid-late 5th century at Athens, as these features more closely 
resemble those found on the early-mid 5th century issues (&quot;Starr groups&quot;).

Good VF, toned. Attractive early style. 
($750) 

While not quite as early as the previous piece, this tetradrachm also belongs among the earlier period of the &quot;frontal eye&quot; issues of the mid-
late 5th century. The palmette is still delicate, as is the general style of the owl, and the incuse is rather deep and abruptly transitions to the flat 
surface (compare to the following lots).

From the Friend of a Scholar Collection. Ex Lanz 48 (22 May 1989), lot 248. 

The tetradrachms of Athens saw an incredibly broad circulation area, from Egypt to Afghanistan, and as such passed through the hands of a 
myriad of peoples. In some of these areas, merchants or officials would countermark the coins, perhaps as a mark of approval of the weight 
and purity. The types on these marks are widely varied, ranging from simple chisel cuts, to punched letters, to elaborate types, some even 
duplicating those found on the coin itself (see CNG E-283, lot 82).

Transition From Frontal to Profile Eye 

115. 
ATTICA, Athens. Circa 404/3-400/390 BC. AR Tetradrachm (23mm, 17.08 g, 8h). Helmeted head of Athena 
right, with frontal eye / Owl standing right, head facing; olive sprig and crescent behind; all within incuse square. Cf. Kroll 
8 (obverse) and 15 (reverse); HGC 4, 1597 (obverse) and 1598 (reverse). Good VF, lightly toned. Well centered. Very rare 
transitional issue, bridging the frontal and profile eye coinages. 
($750) 

This exceptional piece clearly bridges the gap between the mid-late 5th century frontal eye issue that ended circa 404 BC, and the early 
4th century profile eye issue that is thought to have begun circa 400/390 BC. Here, the general style is that found on the profile-eye issue, 
particularly the broad face of Athena on the obverse and the position of the letter alpha on the reverse (see, e.g., Kroll, &quot;Athenian Tetradrachm 
Coinage of the First Half of the Fourth Century BC&quot; in RBN CLVII [2011], p. 4 and fig. 1B). However, the salient feature of that coinage, the 
profile eye, is not present; the eye is still frontal. While it is possible that this may be a coin of the earliest phase of the nascent profile-eye 
issue, it is quite possible that this may be a remnant of a tentative issue bridging the two in the short period c. 404/3-400/390 BC that has no 
previously attributed silver. As with the early profile eye coinage, the rarity of this coinage today is likely a testament to not only the brevity 
of the issue, but also the success of the succeeding pi-style coinage in 353 BC, which was an attempt by the Athenian government to restrike 
all of the old silver coins within its territory.

Pantikapaion was founded by Greek colonists from Miletos in the late seventh century BC. Situated on the west side of the Cimmerian 
Bosporos, in what is now called the Crimea, it achieved great prosperity through its exploitation of the abundant fisheries of the straits and the 
export of wheat from the Crimea. This wealth is attested by its splendid gold coinage, which commenced in the mid-4th century BC, and by 
the magnificently furnished rock tombs of its principal citizens in the same period. Later, it was to become a regional capital of the kingdom 
of Mithradates VI of Pontos (120-63 BC) and later still the seat of the kings of Bosporos (first century BC -fourth century AD). The coinage 
of Pantikapaion seems to have commenced with silver issues in the latter part of the fifth century BC, but it is for its beautiful gold staters that 
the mint is chiefly noted. They depict the head of the god Pan (a pun on the name of the city) and on the reverse the griffin that Herodotos 
describes as being the guardian of the remote sources of gold.

For this date, Callataÿ (p. 44, n. 84) notes only the two tetradrachms cited by RG (in the Bunbury and Mihailovich collections), and none 
were in his recent supplement. As both of the two known pieces were unillustrated, Callataÿ did not include them in his die study, and simply 
cited them in his text. The present piece is clearly from Callataÿ&apos;s obverse die 19, which was previously known on tetradrachms of month 11.

This tetradrachm was struck during a pivotal year in the Third Mithradatic War. Following Mithradates&apos; defeat at Kabeira 71 BC, he had fled 
to the safety of Armenia, where his son-in-law, Tigranes II, ruled. Mithradates slowly assembled an army, and, in 67 BC, defeated the armies 
of the Roman legates M. Fabius and L. Triarius Valerius at Zela. This defeat forced the Romans to retreat to Galatia, allowing the Pontic king 
to return to his throne. His victory was short-lived, as Mithradates soon faced another Roman army, now headed by Pompey the Great. At 
the Battle of the Lykos River in 66 BC, Pompey decisively defeated the Pontic forces, forcing Mithradates to flee Pontos for Armenia. He 
ultimately fled to the Bosporan Kingdom, headed by his son, Pharnakes II, but Mithradates&apos; ambitious plans to revive the war with Rome never 
materialized. In 63 BC, Pharnakes, in fear of the Romans, revolted against his father, who subsequently committed suicide.

Electrum of Kyzikos 

The celebrated electrum coinage of Kyzikos began in the first half of the sixth century, and from the beginning the coinage was notable for 
the variety and inventiveness of its designs. These staters and fractions were regarded as gold coins and circulated throughout a large area 
along with the gold darics of the Persian Empire. On all of the coins of Kyzikos, large or small, was engraved the tunny-fish (θυννος), 
which constituted an important product in the Kyzikene economy. The long awaited corpus initiated by the late Friedrich Bodenstedt is now 
being continued by Maria Kaiser-Raiss. In the meantime, we must rely on the synthesis of material put together by Hans von Fritze in 1914, 
augmented (and corrected) by the articles by Sylvia Hurter and Hans-Joachim Liewald. Hurter studied the electrum coinage of Kyzikos for 
some time before her untimely death in 2008. It was her conviction that the arrangement of the coins by Agnes Baldwin Brett in the catalog of 
the Boston Museum of Fine Arts was the most accurate to date (reflected in the &quot;Editor&apos;s note&quot; at the beginning of the article on the Kyzikene 
coins in Moscow and St. Petersburg in SNR 2007). Thus, the coinage of Kyzikos below is arranged accordingly. 

More controversially, Yuri Pokras (&quot;A New Iconography for the Electrum Coins of Kyzikos,&quot; The Celator November 2000, pp.18-26) has 
tried to argue that Athens invested Kyzikos with the status of subsidiary mint, and that the presence of specific types parallels each city-state&apos;s 
inclusion into an alliance with Athens. 

The orator Aristotelis, in the second century BC, stated the following in his speech regarding the people of Kyzikos: &quot;It is enough for one 
just to glance at the location and the nature of this city to immediately understand that the name &apos;blissful&apos; given to it by God was factual, so 
convenient is its land and its sea. As it is built in front of Asia Minor and since its dominion extends from the Black Sea to the Hellespont, 
Kyzikos joins the two seas together or rather all the seas that man navigates. Thus, ships continuously pass by or arrive at the harbor or depart 
from the harbor. Justly it should be called &apos;blissful&apos; just as is Corinth because, as it is built in the mid part of the seas, it joins, as if it was the 
center of the world, all men who sail the Mediterranean from Gibraltar to Kolchis at the far side of the Black Sea.&quot;

The only extant species in the genus Luvarus and the family Luvaridae, the louvar, known in German as the Dianafisch and in Spanish as the 
emperador, dates from the Paleogene period, and is closely related to the surgeonfish. A large ellipsoidal fish, it can grow up to 2m (over 6 
feet) in length and is considered a delicacy, but is rarely found in fish stores and is usually caught &apos;by-catch.&apos; See Gemini VII, lot 462 for the 
stater of this issue, and CNG 99, lot 170 for the hemihekte. Hurter &amp; Liewald placed this issue in a section of coins &quot;associated to Kyzikos&quot;, 
as they doubted the attribution without further information (they knew of only one example appearing in a private collection). However, a 
few more of these have recently come to market alongside contemporary issues definitively placed at Kyzikos, so the attribution to that city 
must be accepted.

($3000) 

Von Fritze 42, like some of the electrum issues of Kyzikos, is very similar to another issue, von Fritze 84, and can only be distinguished by 
subtle elements of the style. Here, the lion is poised with both front feet on the tunny, its jaws wide open, and the tail curved down between 
its hind legs. In contrast, on type 84, the lion has one forepaw raised, its mouth is only slightly opened, and its tail hangs down behind the tail 
of the tunny. While type 84 is relatively common, coins of type 42 are very rare.

Myth of Erichthonios 

190.

($10,000) 

The myth of Erichthonios places him at the beginning of the line of Athenian kings. Born of Gaia through Hephaestus, the infant was entrusted 
to Athena, who gave him to the daughters of Kekrops of Athens in a sealed casket. When they opened the casket, the sight of the anguipedic 
(serpent-footed) Erichthonios drove the women to madness, and they hurled themselves off the Acropolis. Erichthonios was then left to 
found a new dynasty of the early kings of Athens. Although here the child is shown fully human, this rare Kyzikene stater is undoubtedly a 
representation of the beginning of this tale.

From the LVL Collection. 

This type is thought to portray a Trojan War-related scene, with Thetis carrying the shield forged by Hephaistos to her son Achilles, for whom 
her wreath is also intended. However, Greenwell advanced an alternate theory, that it is a naval victory-related scene depicting a nereid, likely 
in commemoration of the Battle of Kyzikos in 410 BC. 

192. 
MYSIA, Kyzikos. Circa 450-330 BC. EL Stater (17.5mm, 15.96 g). Half-length figure of Athena half-left, head left,

Brett (in BMFA) notes that this type likely commemorates a naval victory of Athens that involved the Kyzikene fleet, perhaps even the Battle 
of Kyzikos in 410 BC, after which the city became a firm ally of Athens.

Lifelike Poseidon 

199. 
MYSIA, Kyzikos. Circa 450-330 BC. EL Stater (17.5mm, 16.01 g). Poseidon, nude but for cloak hanging over 
his left shoulder, kneeling right, holding dolphin in extended right hand, left hand holding trident downward, on tunny right / 
Quadripartite incuse square. Von Fritze I 146; Greenwell 6; cf. Boston MFA 1516 = Warren 1428 (hekte); SNG BN -; BMC

only the Hunt piece in CoinArchives. Traité notes an example in Paris, but this is erroneous, and the illustration listed for that 
example is actually the BM coin. 
($7500) 

This depiction of Poseidon is one of the most intriguing types of the Kyzikene series, since his pose is unusual compared to other coinages 
that typically depict him standing and holding his trident in a more authoritative manner. The latter stye is expected given the nature of the 
deity as a supreme lord over the seas, whereas here he is depicted in a lifelike pose. The composition of the scene suggests a subsequent 
action involving the dolphin, since his trident is held in a neutral fashion and his gaze is forward, as if he is preparing to place the dolphin 
into motion. As such, it seems that this is unlikely a commemoration of an event involving the city&apos;s navy, but rather some scene tied to the 
city&apos;s mythology.

Herakles or Jason? 

202. 
MYSIA, Kyzikos. Circa 450-330 BC. EL Stater (15.5mm, 15.97 g). Nude hero (Herakles or Jason?), wearing 
conical hat, holding club in right hand, animal skin draped over left arm, kneeling right on tunny right / Quadripartite incuse

2185; Myrmekion 45-51; Rosen -; Weber -. VF. 
($5000) 

The identification of the hero on the obverse of this issue is uncertain. In older references he was identified as Herakles, but this was based 
on examples on which the conical hat was not visible. The use of this headgear makes it unlikely that it is Herakles that is depicted here. 
As an alternative, Jameson suggested the hero Jason, in which case the animal skin would be the Golden Fleece. That hero&apos;s hat, though, 
is traditionally depicted as a much more broad-rimmed device (see, e.g., AGCG 374), unlike the narrow hat on this issue. Most modern 
references simply refer to the figure as a hero.

According to Xenophon (Hell. 3.1.6), the cities of Teuthrania and Halisarna were ruled by the brothers Eurysthenes and Prokles as a hereditary 
territory that had been awarded to their ancestor, the exiled king of Sparta, Demaratos the Lakedaimon, by Xerxes for accompanying the Great 
King on his Greek expedition (see Hdt. Book 7 for the relationship between the two). The hereditary rule of Teuthrania and Halisarna by the 
direct descendants of Demaratos, among whom were Eurystenes and Prokles -namesakes of the twin ancestral establishers of the Spartan 
royal line, suggests that these rulers were not satraps, but local dynasts (for a bibliography of the discussion on the differentiation between 
satraps and dynasts, see O. Mørkholm, &quot;Pergamene Coins in Copenhagen,&quot; in Studies Mildenberg, p. 182, note 2). Thus, this is one of the 
earliest depictions of a Greek ruler on a coin.

Recognizing a New Variety 

238. 
LESBOS, Mytilene. Circa 521-478 BC. EL Hekte -Sixth Stater (10mm, 2.51 g, 11h). Head of ram left; below, cock 
standing right, pecking at the ground; E ¬ below / Incuse head of Herakles right, wearing lion skin headdress; incuse club 
below. Bodenstedt Em. 21 var. (no letters on obv.); HGC 6, 947 var. (same). VF, toned. Rare variety. 
($300) 

Although this variety was unknown to Bodenstedt, a number of examples have appeared on the market recently, though the letters were not 
noticed (see, e.g., CNG E-351, lot 259 and NAC 78, lot 1469). 

Hybrid or New Emission? 

239. 
LESBOS, Mytilene. Circa 521-478 BC. EL Hekte -Sixth Stater (10.5mm, 2.47 g, 9h). Head of ram left; below, cock 
standing right, pecking at the ground / Incuse head of lion right; rectangular punch to left. Cf. Bodenstedt Em. 21 (for obv.) / 2, 
15, 16, 20, and 26 (for rev.); cf. HGC 6, 947/941 (for obv./rev.); CNG 97, lot 175 (same dies); Lanz 154, lot 163 (same dies); 
Lanz 146, lot 175 (same dies); Gemini X, lot 113 (same dies). VF, a few light marks. Very rare. 
($300) 

At first glance, it appears that this coin is a hybrid of an obverse of Bodenstedt Em. 21 (ram&apos;s head left with cock below) and the reverse of 
either Bodenstedt Em. 2, 15, 16, 20, or 26 (incuse lion&apos;s head right). However, the reverse die used here does not match any of those published 
in Bodenstedt, but does match other hybrids found in CoinArchives (see above). The obverse die used here also does not match those of 
emission 21 published by Bodenstedt, but again, does match the other hybrids found in CoinArchives. Therefore, it is quite possible that these 
coins represent a different emission rather than a hybrid. 

240. 
LESBOS, Mytilene. Circa 478-455 BC. EL Hekte -Sixth Stater (10mm, 2.53 g, 9h). Head of lion right / Head

244. 
LESBOS, Mytilene. Circa 478-455 BC. EL Hekte -Sixth Stater (10mm, 2.54 g, 3h). Helmeted head of Athena right 
/ Incuse facing head of lion. Bodenstedt Em. 30; HGC 6, 957. VF. Well centered. Rare. 
($500) 

245. 
LESBOS, Mytilene. Circa 478-455 BC. EL Hekte -Sixth Stater (10.5mm, 2.53 g, 12h). Head of Apollo right, 
wearing laurel wreath / Incuse female head right, wearing sphendone. Bodenstedt Em. 31; HGC 6, 958. VF, minor edge split. 
Very rare. 
($300) 

246. 
LESBOS, Mytilene. Circa 455/4 BC. EL Hekte -Sixth Stater (10.5mm, 2.50 g, 9h). Facing gorgoneion / Incuse 
head of lynx facing. Bodenstedt Em. 53.2; HGC 6, 952. VF, toned. Very rare. 
($500) 

This issue likely was the last of the incuse-reverse emissions in the electrum series at Mytilene. In the recent Triton XX sale, lot 261 was a 
hekte of these same types, but with the lynx head in relief. It was unknown to Bodenstedt. Although similar types do recur in the Mytilene 
series, and are not consecutive, the close similarity of the obverse styles of the incuse and relief issues suggests a common die engraver 
(compare the Triton coin with CNG 103, lot 238).

Two Extremely Rare Issues With Chalkidian Helmet 

269. 
LESBOS, Mytilene. Circa 454-428/7 BC. EL Hekte -Sixth Stater (10.5mm, 2.52 g, 5h). Head of Athena right, 
wearing Chalkidian helmet / Two confronted female heads, their faces overlapping, within incuse square. Bodenstedt Em. 
55 var. (Corinthian helmet); HGC 6, 981 var. (same); NAC 78, lot 1471 (same dies); cf. Gemini IX, lot 111 (same obv. die, 
different rev. type). VF. Well centered. Extremely rare variety, only the NAC piece published (in Good VF, but off center, 
hammer 3500 CHF). 
($750) 

The Athena on Bodenstedt&apos;s emission 55 is depicted in the usual manner, wearing a Corinthian helmet tilted back on her head. This coin 
clearly shows her wearing a Chalkidian helmet. This helmet it thought to be a derivative of the Corinthian helmet, and became popular in the 
5th-4th centuries BC. It was lighter than the Corinthian helmet, and afforded its wearer better visibility and hearing while worn. 

Struck from the same obverse die as the following lot, but with a different reverse type. 

270. 
LESBOS, Mytilene. Circa 454-428/7 BC. EL Hekte -Sixth Stater (10mm, 2.54 g, 2h). Head of Athena right, 
wearing Chalkidian helmet / Confronted rams&apos; heads; palmette above; all within incuse square. Bodenstedt -, but cf. Em. 57, 
reverse die α; HGC 6, -; Gemini IX, lot 111 (same dies); cf. NAC 78, lot 1471 (same obv. die, different rev. type). Good VF, 
lightly toned, obverse off center and with spot of die rust, some die wear on reverse. Well centered. Extremely rare, only the 
Gemini piece published (of similar grade and strike, hammer $8000). 
($300) 

See previous lot, struck from the same obverse die, for a discussion of this unusual obverse type.

Apollo right / Head of calf right within incuse square. Bodenstedt Em. 56; HGC 6, 982. Good VF, toned. Well centered and 
struck.

This emission of coins may actually belong to the following period of coinage, dated circa 412-387 BC. See lot 275 below, struck from the

New Type Requires Reordering of Bodenstedt 

275. 
LESBOS, Mytilene. Circa 454-428/7 or 412-387 BC. EL Hekte -Sixth Stater (10mm, 2.56 g, 1h). Head of Ares 
right, wearing crested helmet decorated with forepart of griffin / Head of calf right within incuse square. Bodenstedt -, new 
emission combining an obverse die of Em. 66 with reverse die ε of Em. 56. VF, lightly toned, slightly off center. Important 
new discovery. 
($500) 

This fascinating issue combining obverse die of Em. 66 with reverse die ε of Em. 56 requires a modification to the ordering of Bodenstedt&apos;s 
emissions, and a modification in the dating of these two emissions, since they were previously thought to belong to separate periods. Although 
emission 66 was quite rare previously, a number have come on the market in recent years, some of which were struck from this same obverse 
die. All of those examples, as well as the two in Bodenstedt, exhibit significant die wear to their obverses; thus the die must have been paired 
with the present reverse type first. The question, though, is whether emission 56 belongs to the later period, or 66 to the earlier? Unfortunately, 
neither emission is die linked to any other emission, so it is not yet possible to determine the answer.

EF, lightly toned.

Em. 64; HGC 6, 990. Good VF, lightly toned. Rare. 
($750) 

Parallels have been drawn between the obverse of this type and the facing head Apollo on the famous &apos;Parthenon Group&apos; tetradrachms of 
Amphipolis. As the present coinage was struck decades prior to that of Amphipolis, one wonders whether this issue of Mytilene influenced 
the masterful artists of the Macedonian city.

The Coinage of Phanes 

290. 
IONIA, Ephesos. Phanes. Circa 625-600 BC. EL Trite -Third Stater (14.5mm, 4.65 g). [ß]oeN~F, stag grazing 
right, its dappled coat indicated by indentations on the body / Two incuse punches, each with raised intersecting lines. Weidauer 
40; SNG München 14; ACGC 54; GPCG p. 98, 3; Kraay &amp; Hirmer 585; Zhuyuetang 8. VF, lightly toned. Very rare, fewer than 
twenty trites of Phanes known. 
($15,000) 

The celebrated coins of Phanes -the first coins on which a legend appears -are known to be among the earliest of Greek coins, as a hemihekte 
(twelfth stater) of the issue was found in the famous foundation deposit of the temple of Artemis at Ephesos. It is this find spot, along with 
the design of the grazing stag (an animal associated with Artemis and which was used on later Ephesian issues), that has suggested Ephesos 
as the mint. 

The Phanes coinage consists of seven denominations, from stater down to 1/96 stater, with some denominations occurring in different varieties 
(the stag facing in different directions and sometimes associated with the symbol of a pentagram or a triad of pellets). Only the two largest 
denominations bear the name of Phanes. The staters carry the legend ΦΑΝΕΟΣ ΕΜΙ ΣΗΜΑ (or similar) (&quot;I am the badge of Phanes&quot;), and 
the trites (third staters) bear just the name ΦΑΝΕΟΣ (&quot;of Phanes&quot;). The Phanes who issued these coins is otherwise unattested. The use of a 
personal name at this early point in the development of coinage is instructive. We know from these coins that the responsibility for the issue 
was personal -whether the issuer was an official or a private individual -rather than collective, i.e. the citizenry as a whole. 

291.

King Midas 

314. 
IONIA, Phokaia. Circa 478-387 BC. EL Hekte -Sixth Stater (10.5mm, 2.53 g). Bearded head of King Midas 
left; to right, small seal downward / Quadripartite incuse square. Bodenstedt Em. 66. VF, lightly toned. Well centered. Very 
rare. 
($750) 

The mythic king Midas of Phrygia and Lydia may not have invented coinage, as one version of the story goes, but his name became a byword 
for the consequences of foolish choices. He was the judge in a musical contest between Apollo and Marsyas (or Pan in another version). When 
he decided against the Olympian, Apollo reacted to his lack of musical taste and bad judgment by giving him ass&apos;s ears. Midas wore a cap 
from that point onward. The tale of Midas is more familiarly known as a cautionary warning about the acquisition of excessive wealth and 
subsequent downfall by excessive greed. The king, who had been a gracious host to Silenos, the companion of Dionysos, was promised a boon 
by the god, and implored Dionysos for unending wealth. Midas was granted the &quot;Golden Touch&quot; whereby everything he touched turned to 
the precious metal. This proved a benefit with a double edge, since no morsel of food could pass his lips without transforming. Starving and 
pleading for relief, the king was instructed to bathe in the waters of the river Pactolus, which washed away the curse and resulted in the river 
sand turning to grains of gold. The gold of the Pactolus would be used to make the electrum of the first archaic coinages of Asia Minor, and 
Midas would become a local hero of Phrygia and Lydia, despite his lack of foresight.

The identity of the individual on the obverse of this issue is uncertain, though both Bodenstedt and Winzer name Tissaphernes. A number 
of satraps, including Tissaphernes, issued coinage in their own name with their portraits, and researchers have attempted to draw parallels 
between those portraits and that on the present coinage, though none have been conclusive.

Quadripartite incuse square punch with a pellet in the center; each quarter contains a diagonal line radiating from the central pellet; 
some sections contain further lines. McFadden 4; Elektron II 16; Traité -; SNG Kayhan 701. Near EF. Rare. 
($300) 

343.

standard. Square object (swastika?) with lines radiating from each side / Incuse square. Unpublished in the standard references. 
Good VF, as made. 
($300) 

This interesting electrum fraction has an obverse that parallels the design on Rosen 363 and 364, but those coins were struck on the Samian 
standard. The design is also similar to the Lydo-Milesian standard fractions of SNG Kayhan 702-3, but those coins lack the radiating lines. 
At the same time, the form of the incuse here is significantly different from either of the aforementioned issues, so it may not be related to 
either of them.

When the Pergamene king Attalos II died in 134 BC, he bequeathed his kingdom to the Romans. Because the Romans were slow in securing 
their claim, Aristonikos, son of the earlier Pergamene king Eumenes II, filled the power vacuum, claiming the throne and taking the dynastic 
name Eumenes. Although he was unable to capture Pergamon, his revolt lasted four years, until he was defeated and captured by the Romans 
under the consul M. Perperna. After his surrender, he was paraded through Rome and executed.

KINGS of LYDIA. Alyattes. Circa 620/10-564/53 BC. EL Trite -Third Stater (12.5mm, 4.69 g). Sardes mint. Head

The lion head/incuse coinage is among the earliest firmly attributed to the Lydian kingdom, and its origins date to the time of Alyattes, who 
ruled circa 620/10-564/53 BC. While most of the coins are anepigraphic, a small number of them bear the inscription Walwel or Kukalim in 
Lydian. Although these names likely equate to Alyattes and Gyges, respectively, hoard studies have shown that these coins were not only 
contemprary with one another, but also with the anepigraphic issues. Thus, while Walwel may refer to the king, Kukalim most likely refers to 
another member of the royal family or some other high official. 

All trites and hektes with the inscription Walwel or Kukalim are struck from obverse dies that are much larger than the respective denominations 
require. These dies contain two opposing lion heads with the Lydian inscription between, and the coin blanks were struck off-center, in such 
a way that only one of the lion heads would be visible with the inscription. On the right edge of the obverse of the present coin, one may see 
the nose and tip of the jaw of the opposing lion head.

($25,000) 

The &apos;Kroisos&apos; type coinage is one of the most recognizable of all ancient Greek coinage. All of the issues in the bimetallic, gold and silver, 
series feature the same confronted lion and bull foreparts on the obverse, and two incuse punches (or a single punch in the case of small 
denominations) on the reverse. The series began on a &apos;heavy&apos; standard, with gold and silver staters of equal weight, around 10.6-10.7 grams, 
which was later reduced to about 8.17 grams for the gold. Recent studies have shown that coins of both standards circulated together, but that 
the heavy standard was only used for a relatively short time compared to the light standard, which continued to be used into the Persian period. 
The Kroiseids have also traditionally been broken down into two stylistic groups, &apos;realistic&apos; and &apos;stylized&apos;, with hoard evidence suggesting 
that the former belonged to the time of Kroisos, while the latter were of the time of the Persians. The present coin, however, is from an issue 
that constitutes a third group that has a more archaic style, which has features that suggest it is the first issue of Kroisos&apos; bimetallic coinage. 

This prototype issue was first noted and analyzed in an article by Paolo Naster in 1964 (&quot;Une série aberrante de Créséides&quot; in BSFN 19 
(1964), pp. 364-5, reprinted in P. Naster, Scripta Nummaria: Contributions à la méthodologie numismatique [Louvian-la-Neuve, 1983], pp. 
76-7). The archaic character of the type is most evident in the bull, where the fine waves of hair on the later coinage are here represented as 
a series of pelleted lines emanating from a solid arc that forms the animal&apos;s neckline. At the same time, antecedents of the style of the lion 
can be seen in the earlier electum coinage, particularly the hemihektai of Weidauer&apos;s Group XVI. The most significant feature linking this 
issue to the electrum, though, is the appearance of the small pellet or protuberance on the head of the lion. This feature, usually featuring rays 
emanating from it, is canonical on all the earlier electrum coinage from the time of Ardys until the early part of Kroisos&apos; reign. It is a feature 
that is totally lacking on the bimetallic coinage of the &apos;realistic&apos; and, later, &apos;stylized&apos; character. A final unusual feature particular to this issue 
is the depiction of the arms of the lion and bull, which are shown bent nearly 90 degrees at their mid-point, rather than in a straight line from 
shoulder to paw and hoof. 

The rarity today of these early style staters also suggests that the issue was short-lived, perhaps a trial run before the style was standardized. 
Martin Price also noted this unusual emission of staters (&quot;Croesus or Pseudo-Croesus?&quot; in Festschrift Mildenberg, p. 221, n. 25), and, like 
Naster, placed them between the electrum and the gold of standard style.

The portraits on coins in the later Lycian series are among the finest of the Classical period. Among the earliest to attempt depictions of 
their rulers on coinage, the Lycians&apos; first portraits in the later 5th century BC were innovative, but static, idealized forms lacking individual 
characterization. Over the next half-century, however, the style progressed significantly toward realism, culminating in the issues of the dynasts 
Mithrapata and Perikles in the early-mid 4th century BC. The coins of Mithrapata came first, depicting on their reverse the profile portrait 
of a man with distinctive elderly features. Through the relative chronology established in L. Mildenberg&apos;s die study, one can even see the 
portrait become more aged as time progressed, reflecting the realism that had been captured in these issues. The coins of Perikles, Mithrapata&apos;s 
successor, continue this trend, but also have two innovations that set them at the pinnacle of classical portraiture. First, the portrait is moved to 
the obverse of the coin, emphasizing the importance of the individual. Second, and most prominently, the portrait is not in the traditional profile, 
but in a dramatic facing state. Obviously influenced by Kimon&apos;s facing Arethusa-head coinage at Syracuse, these depict Perikles looking out 
from the surface of the coin with a serene countenance and his hair flowing around him as if blown by the wind. This depiction captures the 
essence of the earlier idealized portraits, conveying to the viewer a sense that Perikles was more than a mere man, but retaining the realism in 
its individualized features. Interestingly, both Mithrapata and Perikles are depicted without any sort of satrapal headgear, which was always 
included in earlier Lycian portraits, perhaps indicating that they had declared their independence from the Persian king. These astonishing 
developments in portraiture came to an abrupt end in Lycia when Maussollos of Caria invaded the region circa 360 BC.

Pnytagoras came to power following the deposition of his half-uncle Evagoras II, who was expelled by his subjects after refusing to support 
a revolt against the Persians. Following the revolt, the Persians mounted an invasion to retake Cyprus and supported Evagoras in his bid to 
regain his throne in Salamis. Soon, however, unknown accusations were made against Evagoras, which prompted the Persians to change 
their support to Pnytagoras, who subsequently submitted to the Persian king. After the battle of Ipsos, Pnytagoras allied himself with the 
Macedonians, and his fleet participated in the important siege of Tyre in 332 BC. Following the siege, Alexander rewarded Pnytagoras with 
the city of Tamassos, which had been a possession of Kition. Pnytagoras died later that same year and was succeeded by his son, Nikokreon. 
Pnytagoras&apos; gold staters feature the bust of Cypriote Aphrodite, as celebrated by her numerous cult centers on the island. Her turreted crown 
on the obverse of this coin shows her assimilation to Tyche as the protecting civic goddess for the whole of Cyprus.

Continued Herodian support of the Romans allowed the dynasty to extend its influence beyond Jewish territories. Herod V, the grandson of 
Herod the Great, was granted the kingdom of Chalkis by Claudius in 41 upon the request of Agrippa I, and all of Herod&apos;s rare coins name 
the emperor. His friendship with and loyalty to the emperor continued to benefit him; following the death of Agrippa in 44, Claudius granted 
Herod authority over affairs at the Temple in Jerusalem, a right he retained until his death some four years later.

There is much debate concerning the identity of the hero on the obverse of this type. The most common suggestions are Alexander the Great, 
Seleukos, or a personification of Dionysos. See O.D. Hoover, &quot;The Identity of the Helmeted Head on the &apos;Victory&apos; Coinage of Susa,&quot; SNR 81 
(2002), for the most recent treatment of this debate.

Extremely Rare Obodas I Drachm 

434. 
NABATAEA. Obodas I. Circa 96-86 BC. AR Drachm (16mm, 3.47 g, 1h). Ptolemaic standard. Petra mint(?). Dated 
RY 11 (86 BC). Diademed and draped bust right / ∫Å%5¬EW% o∫odÅ, eagle standing left on thunderbolt; l5Å (date) to left. 
Unpublished. Good VF, dark find patina. Extremely rare, one of two known (the other is unpublished). 
($30,000) 

This extremely rare Nabataean drachm, one of two examples known, raises several questions. The first is the identity of the &quot;Obodas&quot; named 
as the issuer. Traditionally, three Nabataean kings are thought to have been named Obodas: Obodas I (circa 96-86 BC), Obodas II (62-60 BC), 
and Obodas III (30-9 BC). This chronology had remained unquestioned among scholars, even as recently as 2002 when Jane Taylor (p. 219) 
published her Petra and the Lost Kingdom of the Nabataeans. In 2010, however, Martin Huth (&quot;Some Nabataean Questions Reconsidered&quot; in 
Coinage of the Caravan Kingdoms, pp. 215-7), argued convincingly that only two kings of that name existed, thus removing the previously-
named Obodas II from the list of monarchs. This chronological reassessment is a critical element in securing the proper attribution of this 
drachm. 

Although the coins of Obodas II are relatively common, no coins have previously been assigned to Obodas I. The present coin is distinct in 
several respects from the coinage of Obodas II and almost certainly belongs to Obodas I. The fine Hellenistic style of the present coin is quite 
different from the many issues of Obodas II. The legend is in Greek rather than Aramaic. The weight is based on the Ptolemaic standard, unlike 
the coins of Obodas II, which are struck on the Phoenician standard. The form of the regnal date is likewise based on Ptolemaic practice. 

Furthermore, the reverse type of our coin would be entirely inappropriate for Obodas II (30-9 BC), considering the historical context of 
Obodas II&apos;s reign. Under Malichus I (59-30 BC), the Nabataeans sided with Antony and Cleopatra against Herod I, defeating Herod in 32 
BC at the Battle of Qanata. The following year, however, Nabataean fortunes changed; they were defeated by Herod of Judaea, and then 
the Nabataeans&apos; main allies Antony and Cleopatra were defeated at Actium. Following these defeats, the Nabataean kingdom under Obodas 
II became a client-state of Rome. The reverse of this drachm, with the eagle standing on a thunderbolt, is a recognizable &quot;Egyptian&quot; type, 
which, along with the Egyptian style date (LIA), would have recalled the alliance between the Nabataeans and the Ptolemaic kingdom under 
Cleopatra. For a Roman client-king to strike such a coin would have invited a crushing rebuke from his new Roman overlord. Yet, there is no 
evidence of this, and Obodas II appears to have enjoyed a long 21-year reign. 

All the evidence thus supports the attribution of this coin to Obodas I (circa 96-86 BC), and this coin of Regnal Year 11 should equate to 
the last year of his reign. Josephus (BJ 1.4.4) tells us that Obodas defeated the Hasmoneans, subsequently ambushing Alexander Jannaios 
(Yehonatan) near Gadara in revenge for the Nabataean loss of Gaza. In 86 BC, Obodas defeated the Seleukids at the Battle of Cana, at which 
Antiochos XII Dionysos was killed, and the Nabataeans conquered Damaskos, thereby increasing their power in the region. As a result, 
Obodas was venerated by the Nabataeans as a god and deified after his death, because he had defeated both the Hasmoneans and the Seleukids. 
This drachm was perhaps struck as a celebratory issue in the aftermath of Obodas&apos; victory over the Seleukids, as the regnal date likely equates 
to the same year as this event.

($10,000) 

This lovely bronze type, while ostensibly displaying Aphrodite holding Eros in her arms, was in fact a dynastic issue, following in the 
Ptolemaic tradition that rulers were represented in the guise of gods. Here, the identification of Kleopatra as Aphrodite is not controversial, as 
the two are often related in classical literature. The choice of this type is relative to its place of the issue, Cyprus, where an important temple 
to Aphodite was located at Paphos. In 48 BC, Julius Caesar gave Cyprus to Kleopatra, and the fact that Caesarion was his son by the Egyptian 
queen lends credence to the identification of Eros as Caesarion on this coin. Literary and epigraphic evidence clearly displays the intent of 
Kleopatra to elevate their son to the status of a co-ruler, and as such, his presence on the coin would be conventional. Nonetheless, other 
candidates have been suggested, such as either of her sons by Mark Antony, Alexander Helios or Ptolemy Philadelphos. As the coin has no 
indication of date, it could have been struck later, after Kleopatra gave birth to Antony&apos;s children. Two facts, though, suggest that this isolated 
issue would not favor either of these children over Caesarion. In 34 BC, when Antony was celebrating his Armenian &apos;victory&apos; at Alexandreia, 
Caesarion was given a higher status in the event than Antony&apos;s sons. Also, numismatic evidence suggests that Caesarion retained his position 
as primary heir until Kleopatra&apos;s death (see O. Mørkholm, &quot;Ptolemaic Coins and Chonology&quot; in MN 20 [1975]). It seems appropriate that 
this exceptional issue would have been struck in commemoration of Caesarion&apos;s birth in 47 BC, on the island that had just been given to his 
mother, Kleopatra, by his father, Caesar.

light toning, coins (a) and (c) with light porosity. All coins struck from the same obverse die, coins (a), (b), and (c) also struck 
from the same reverse die. 
($2000) 

This group of four tetradrachms provides useful evidence regarding the control marks on the coinage of Eukratides I. All four coins share the 
same obverse die, and the three tetradrachms with the T control (coins a-c) share the same reverse die. The fourth coin (coin d), however, was 
struck with a reverse that has the control Í (a second example is Qunduz 206). In his discussion on these coins (Indus, p. 96), Bopearachchi 
noted other examples of different control marks linked by the same obverse die. While he does not draw a conclusion about the evidence, he 
does suggest that a more in-depth die study may provide further evidence for the possible arrangement of Bactrian mints.

The name Kushan derives from the Chinese term Guishuang, used to describe one branch of the Yuezhi, a loose confederation of Indo-European 
people who had been living in the Xinjiang Province of modern China. Driven west by Xiongnu between 176 and 160 BC, the five groups of the 
Yuezhi -the Xiumi, Guishuang (Kushans), Shuangmi, Xidun, and Dumi -reached the Hellenic kingdom of Baktria by 135 BC. They expelled 
the ruling Greek dynasties there, forcing these kings further south to settle along the Indus River. In the following century, the Guishuang forced 
the other tribes of the Yuezhi into a tight confederation. Now, as the Guishuang was the predominant power, the entire group became known by 
that name. This appellation was Westernized as Kushan, though the Chinese still referred to them as Yuezhi. 

Like the Hellenistic Greeks and Romans, the Kushans were a multi-cultural society, incorporating much of the cultures they ruled into their 
own. Like their Baktrian predeccesors, early Kushan coins used Greek legends on the obverse, along with a translation in the local Karosthi 
script on the reverse. Beginning with Kanishka I, however, the Kushan language, written in an adaptation of the Greek alphabet with some local 
alterations, was used almost exclusively. From the time of Vima Taktu (Soter Megas), the Kushans also began to adopt Indian cultural elements. 
Embracing a wide variety of local Indian and Central Asian deities, they assimilated them with Greco-Roman types already prevalent in the 
region. Overall, the Kushan pantheon represented a religious and artistic syncretism of western and eastern elements. 

An adept military leader who expanded Kushan power throughout much of Central Asia, Vima Kadphises was the first Kushan ruler to send 
a diplomatic mission to Rome, during the reign of Trajan. Vima Kadphises was also the first Kushan ruler to strike gold coins. Because the 
Kushans under his reign had extended their protective control over the Silk Road, the Roman gold they obtained through the trading of luxury 
items with the Roman Empire-such as silk, spices, and other exotic goods-provided the metal for the striking of the first Indian gold coins. 
In addition to the existing copper and silver denominations, Vima Kadphises introduced three gold denominations: the dinar (struck on an 8g 
weight standard), the double dinar, and a fractional quarter dinar. 

The reverse type of these coins, showing the Hindu deity Siva, known to the later Kushans as Oesho, indicates that Vima Kadphises, like his 
father and predecessor, Vima Taktu (Soter Megas) embraced the religion of Shaivism, a branch of Hinduism. Shaivists recognized Siva as the 
supreme god of the Brahma-Siva-Visnu triad, contrary to the more traditional view that the three deities were parts of the Trimurti, the three 
aspects which make up the supreme godhead. Siva is sometimes portrayed as a figure with a tripartite head and is usually shown in association 
with Nandi, the bull of happiness and strength. Siva often appears in an ithyphallic state, recalling the ancient and abstract form of the god: 
that of a conical or ithyphallic-shaped stone, or siva lingam, set within a yoni, a round base with a single projecting channel, which together 
represented the respective male and female parts and the mystical powers of generation. Likewise, these coins also display the Buddhist 
Triratana, or &quot;Three Jewels&quot;, on the reverse, indicating that like his son and successor Kanishka I, Vima Kadphises was interested in Buddhism. 

While the dinars and their fractions were clearly meant to facilitate international trade, the purpose of the double dinars is less certain. While it 
is quite possible that they too were used in trade, especially when larger sums were required, their rarity would seem to indicate that they may 
have served a more special, possibly ceremonial function: gifts presented to the king&apos;s favorites as a way of strengthening support for the regime 
and deposited resources from which the king could later draw.

The god Athsho, or Athosho, appears to derive from the Zoroastrian deity Atar, the son of Ahura Mazda and the personification of holy 
fire, indicated by the flames about Athsho&apos;s head and shoulders. Associated with Aša-Vahišta, the personification of truth or righteousness, 
who appears as Ashaeixsho on coins of Huvishka, the figure of Atar has been employed historically for royal fires. While recognized in 
Iran as a deity, who admitted or rejected souls in heaven, Athsho was mostly closely associated in western Mithraism with Hephaistos. The 
blacksmith&apos;s hammer and tongs, symbols of Hephaistos, were also used as tools for igniting the holy fire (Venidad XIV.7), thus associating 
them also with Athsho. Likewise, in Pahlavi commentary on the Atašnyayiš (Sacred Books of the East XXIII:360, note 6) notes the further 
connection between these two gods in that, like Hephaistos, Athsho &quot;bodily is infirm; spiritually he is a warrior.&quot;

Possible trace of undertype, cut marks on edge of flan indicating the flan for this coin was cut from a larger flan. Apparently 
unique. 
($5000) 

This coin is somewhat of an enigma. While it appears to be an archaic type electrum issue with a design on the obverse and incuse punch on the 
reverse, this incuse of this coin in no way comports with known incuse punches of the archaic period. The punch used on this coin appears to 
be of a plain circular type with no design. The obverse is similarly intriguing. While the lion was a common design element in archaic coinage 
(see CNG 100, lot 1456 for example, an electrum issue of Miletos), the style of this lion appears to be much later in style, and similar to that 
found on a stamp seal of the fourth to eighth centuries AD (cf. J.A. Lerner and N. Sims-Williams, Seals, Sealings and Tokens from Bactria 
to Gandhara (4th to 8th century CE) [2011], E 1.5). Struck on a flan that has been cut down to bring it into a weight (7.96g) consistent with 
dinars of the Kushans or their successors in the Bactria/Gandhara region, this coin may have been an attempt by one of the region&apos;s authorities 
to institute their own &quot;gold&quot; coinage (cf. CNG 103, lots 485 and 486 for examples of pale AV issues of the Kidara Shahis).

Herodotus (circa 485-425) was born to a wealthy family in Halicarnassus, at the time under Persian control, although his family was exiled 
from the city while Herodotus was quite young and he appears to have only briefly returned to his hometown as an adult. He traveled widely 
and included accounts of his experiences in his famous The Histories, a description of the Graeco-Persian Wars. Cicero referred to Herodotus 
as &quot;the father of history&quot; due to his systematic investigation of historical subjects (although others have branded him &quot;father of lies,&quot; as 
Herodotus seems to have subscribed to the idea of not letting facts get in the way of a good story!).

($1000) 

In the initial publication of this interesting coin, Jyrki Muona argued that the portrait is of Otho and shows the influence of the Antioch mint, 
while the latest RPC supplement leans toward an attribution to Galba, based primarily on the hooked nose (see also RPC I 4024 for another 
coin tentatively assigned to Galba). The note in the RPC supplement suggesting that the &quot;M&quot; in the obverse legend could be read as &quot;AΛ&quot; of 
&quot;ΓAΛ(BA),&quot; however, should be discounted. At present the identification is uncertain -while the hooked nose certainly recalls Galba, the 
youthful portrait is more appropriate for Otho.

Kovacs and RPC differ on the identification of the portraits. RPC describes them as the Divus Augustus and Livia. However, on better 
preserved specimens the portraits appear to be male. Furthermore, depictions of Divus Augustus normally feature a radiate crown. Kovacs, 
on the other hand, identifies the portraits as Tiberius and Artaxias III, based on the nearly complete reverse legend on his coin, which reads 
KAI TIBEPI OΣ K Z[HNO]Σ.

The Fall of Jerusalem

SELEUCIS and PIERIA, Antioch. Titus. As Caesar, AD 69-79. AR Tetradrachm (27mm, 12.48 g, 12h). Dated

Fine style portrait. 
($1000) 

The date &quot;Holy Year&quot; 3 coincides with the fall of Jerusalem in August of AD 70, to the Romans under Titus&apos; command. The portrait of Titus is 
similar to that seen on &quot;Judaea Capta&quot; bronze coins, and it is possible that these tetradrachms were struck at the same mint, probably Caesarea 
Maritima (see RPC II p. 276; McAlee p. 173).

JUDAEA, Herodians. Agrippa I, with Claudius. 37-43 CE. AE (28mm, 14.68 g, 12h). Caesarea Maritima mint. 
Dated RY 7 of Agrippa I (42/3 CE). Laureate head of Claudius right / Two figures (Claudius and Agrippa?) standing facing 
one another, each holding patera, within distyle temple; between, torso of figure holding uncertain object above victimarius 
kneeling left, restraining offering; L Z (date) in pediment. Burnett, Coinage 10; Meshorer 121; Hendin 1245; RPC I 4983. 
Near VF, earthen green patina. Rare and with a particularly well-struck reverse. 
($500) 

Agrippa I had a close relationship with both Gaius (Caligula) and Claudius, in part helping to secure the rule of the latter in the uncertain 
days following his unexpected rise to the purple by counseling the understandably shaken Claudius and entreating the Senate to support him. 
Indeed, his relationship with Claudius was sufficiently close that Josephus (Ant. xix. 5.1) records that among the new emperor&apos;s first acts was 
the publication of an edict guaranteeing Agrippa&apos;s kingdom (with the title &quot;great king&quot;) and granting the territory of Chalcis to Agrippa&apos;s elder 
brother Herod. 

Burnett believed the scene on the reverse represented the consecration of this treaty in Rome, a treaty which is specifically mentioned by 
Josephus (He also made a league with this Agrippa, confirmed by oaths, in the middle of the Forum in the city of Rome. [Jospehus, Ant. 
xix.5.1]). Although Suetonius (Suetonius, Claud. 25.5) also places the rites of the treaty (or fetial ceremony), which included the sacrifice of 
a pig, in the Roman Forum, Burnett argued that they instead took place at the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. Following Burnett&apos;s interesting 
argument, this rare Judaean bronze not only represents a religious ceremony before the holiest temple of Rome, but accurately depicts a 
victimarius (sacrificial assistant) about to kill a pig. 

597. 
JUDAEA, Aelia Capitolina (Jerusalem). Caracalla. AD 198-217. AR Tetradrachm (26mm, 13.58 g, 12h). 
Laureate, draped, and curiassed bust right / Eagle standing facing on thyrsus, head and tail left, with wings spread, holding 
wreath in beak; between legs, a theatrical mask to left; grape bunch or crude wine jar in exergue. Cf. Meshorer, Aelia 94; 
Sofaer -; cf. Prieur 1620 (citing 2). VF, light porosity and scratches. Very rare. 
($1000) 

From the same obverse die as Meshorer 94a and Prieur 1620. The symbol in the exergue is either a wine jar as on the examples cited above 
(albeit a very crude one), or, perhaps more likely, a grape bunch. If the latter is correct, this variety is unrecorded in the standard references.

Wonderfully Engraved Domitian Hemidrachm 

599. 
EGYPT, Alexandria. Domitian. AD 81-96. AE Hemidrachm (29mm, 14.96 g, 12h). Dated RY 10 (AD 90/91). Bust 
of Domitian left, wearing aegis and wreath of grain ears / NЄIKH CЄ BACT, Nike seated left on shields and cuirass, holding 
wreath and palm frond; L I (date) before. Köln -; Dattari (Savio) 515 var. (obv. bust and rev. type both facing right); K&amp;G 
24.107 var. (same); RPC II 2573 var. (same); Emmett 270.10 (R4). Near EF, green and brown patina. Exceptionally fine style. 
Very rare. 
($750) 

The authors of RPC note in their introductory comments for Domitian that &quot;From year 10 the style of the engraving improves dramatically 
and a number of variant bust types are found.&quot; This is an understatement, as this is one of the best examples of a celator&apos;s work from the 
Alexandrian mint seen by this cataloguer, and most likely represents an engraver who was brought to Alexandria from Rome or one of the 
mints in Asia Minor. 

Extremely Rare Depiction of an Egyptian Temple 

600. 
EGYPT, Alexandria. Trajan. AD 98-117. AE Drachm (35mm, 25.21 g, 12h). Dated RY 12 (AD 108/109). Laureate 
and draped bust right / Egyptan temple with two pylons enclosing a statue of Ptah(?), which is standing right and holding a 
Canopus; between the pylons above, eagle standing facing, wings spread, head right; below, steps leading to temple; [L I]-B 
(date) to either side of steps. Köln -; Dattari (Savio) 7280-1 var. (obv. bust type with aegis and statue of Ptah facing left); K&amp;G 
-; RPC II 4329 = BMC Suppl. 2781 = Emmett 522.12 (R5). Near Fine, brown surfaces with touches of green, some roughness. 
Extremely rare, possibly the second known for this variety with Ptah facing right, and Trajan&apos;s bust draped right without the 
aegis. 
($1000) 

An extremely rare coin with five examples known, including this coin, for both varieties (RPC II 4328 and 4329 -the first coin cited by RPC 
for 4328, SNG BN 1067, is incorrectly identified and clearly a different variety). The other references tentatively identify the standing figure 
within the temple as Isis, but on the present specimen it is clear that the figure is bald, and without any sort of headdress, hence our attribution 
to Ptah.

frequently in Egyptian art, surrounded by attendants and the fruits of the fertile river.

In around 218 BC, shortly before the appearance of the silver denarius, mints in the Roman Republic began to strike silver coins bearing on 
the obverse a bust of Jupiter and on the reverse a figure of Victory placing a wreath upon a trophy. Known as a victoriatus in Latin or tropaikon 
in Greek, this coin was primarily issued to facilitate payments in Greek-speaking southern Italy, where its weight was roughly equivalent to 
a drachm or half nomos. Rome at this time had a great need for coinage, as the Second Punic War then raged across Italy, and the city needed 
silver to pay her allies. This function is demonstrated by the hoard evidence, which shows that their circulation was generally limited to 
southern Italy, and later Cisalpine Gaul and Spain. 

The victoriatus was generally struck in less pure silver than the denarius, rarely meeting the same 90% standard, yet it generally followed the 
same overall pattern of debasements. Despite this, it proved to be an important coin for the budding empire. Though the type was discontinued 
around 170 BC, the coins themselves continued to circulate, eventually becoming worn enough to function in the marketplace as quinarii. 
Accordingly, even into the early Imperial period, the silver quinarius was also sometimes refered to as a victoriatus.

mint. Head of Gallic captive (Vercingetorix?) right, wearing hair flowing back and long, pointed beard, and a chain around his

From the Collection of a Director. 

The obverse portrait has sometimes been identified as the famous chief of the Arverni, Vercingetorix, whom Julius Caesar captured in 52 BC in 
Alesia. It is difficult to imagine anyone placing such a dramatic portrait of a defeated foe on their coinage, but it is clear from surviving sources 
of the period that the Romans had a good deal of respect for the Gauls as honorable warriors. Crawford and Sear believe this identification is 
unlikely, but the large, distinctive, and carefully engraved head suggests the die cutter worked with an eye toward creating an individualized 
portrait, rather than a stylized personification of a Gaul. The reverse is also of particular historical interest, in that it depicts the manner in 
which chariots were used in Celtic Gaul, and perhaps in Britain as well.

For centuries, numismatists have been puzzled by a curious series of bronze tokens bearing on their reverse numerals from I to XVI. The 
obverse types on these tokens vary dramatically, bearing not only portraits of Augustus, Tiberius, and Livia, but also various erotic scenes, 
heterosexual and (possibly) homosexual, or bigas, maenads, capricorns, and other scattered mythological figures. The most prominent theories 
suggest that they were tickets for entrance to the theater or the games, and the numerals represented sections in the stands, or that they were 
brothel tokens, with the obverse representing a chosen &quot;product&quot; and the reverse the price. However, both of these theories seem unlikely 
when one considers that the two seemingly divergent themes are joined by die links to the numeral reverses. 

Alberto Campana (&quot;Le Spintriae: Tessere Romane con Raffigurazioni Erotiche,&quot; in La Donna Romana Imagini e Vita Quotidiana [2009], pp. 
43-96) has published a die study of the erotic pieces, recording eight specimens with at least basic find spot information, most notably a sealed 
tomb in Modena, firmly dated to the mid-late Julio-Claudian period, as well as other examples found around the Roman world in Palestine, 
Gaul, Germany, and Britain, often in areas of military interest. He notes that these tesserae are primarily struck in orichalcum, a metal more 
valuable than regular copper or bronze. Considering the find spots and the metal used in the tokens, Campana suggests that they were luxury 
gifts given by the Imperial house to important military figures for use in some now-forgotten board game, possibly a variant of duodecim 
scripta, a game resembling modern backgammon (&quot;Les spintriae et leur possible fonction ludique,&quot; in Archeothema 31 [2013], p. 66).

Domitian&apos;s assassination in AD 96 placed the elderly senator Nerva on the throne. While by all accounts a benevolent ruler, his mild ways and 
refusal to execute the murderers of Domitian caused some disaffection within the military, among whom Domitian had enjoyed considerable 
popularity. This reverse type reflects Nerva&apos;s recognition that he needed to placate the army, whose support he eventually gained by adopting 
the able general Trajan.

Nerva attempted to relieve some of the burdens that had been imposed on the people of Italy by his predecessor, Domitian. One of his acts was 
the assumption of the costs of the imperial post by the Roman government, a burden which had formerly fallen on the municipalities. Though 
this event is celebrated on this coin, no contemporary writers mention the act.

Hadrian&apos;s Travel Series 
From the Collection of Dr. Robert B. Beckett, Jr 

Between the years AD 119 and 136, the emperor Hadrian travelled throughout the Roman Empire, visiting various provinces to take stock of 
his inheritance and calm the disquiet which had arisen in the later years of Trajan&apos;s reign. His travels can be divided into two major episodes. 
The first tour was designed to shore-up Rome&apos;s northern borders and began sometime around AD 119 when Hadrian first visited the provinces 
of Gaul and Germania Inferior and Superior. The emperor then crossed the Channel to Britannia where, during his stay, construction began on 
a seventy-three-mile long wall across the north of the province, known to this day as Hadrian&apos;s Wall. In AD 122-123, Hadrian spent time in 
Hispania, then travelled East to Asia Minor. The remainder of this first tour was spent in the Balkans and Greece, touring such areas as Dacia 
and Achaea, before returning to Rome, via Sicily, in AD 126. 

Hadrian&apos;s second tour began in AD 128, when he set out on a short tour of the provinces of Africa and Mauretania. Returning for a brief stay 
in Rome, Hadrian then went again to Asia Minor, and continued into Syria and Palestine. In AD 130, Hadrian moved on to Egypt, where he 
visited Alexandria. It was while Hadrian was on tour in Egypt that his favorite, Antinoüs, mysteriously drowned in the Nile. The Bar Kochba 
revolt in Judaea forced Hadrian to remain in the region until AD 135. In AD 136, Hadrian returned to Italia, ending his long travels.

($1000) 

From the Collection of a Director. 

The discussion of this type in RIC (p. 327) notes that this reverse type &quot;celebrates the military reforms of the emperor&quot;, without defining what 
specific event triggered the commemoration on this sestertius. It is most likely related to the conclusion of the last great military campaign 
of Hadrian&apos;s reign, the Bar Kochba revolt in Judaea (AD 132-135). As an internal revolt, not an operation against foreign foes, the war did 
not warrant a coinage explicitly commemorating its end, but this coin would indirectly mark its conclusion, praising the legions for their 
steadfastness while stressing the reordering of the armies for peacetime and the standing down from a war footing.

In AD 208, Septimius Severus, together with the entire imperial family (his wife Julia Domna and their sons Caracalla and Geta), set out for 
Britain where the situation on the northern frontier demanded urgent attention. He was to spend the last two and a half years of his life in the 
island province and was destined never to return to Rome. Together with his elder son, the co-emperor Caracalla, he campaigned vigorously 
beyond the imperial frontier, penetrating far into Scotland. The line of their marching-camps can still be detected today by aerial photography. 
Severus also restored Hadrian&apos;s Wall, the northern frontier of the province, which was in serious need of renovation now that more than eighty 
years had elapsed since its original construction. Little is known of the success of these military operations, though they were to bring peace 
to the area for the remainder of the third century, and an extensive issue of coinage in all metals was produced to commemorate the British 
victory.

Tetricus II as Augustus 

950. 
Tetricus II. Romano-Gallic Emperor, AD 274. AE Antoninianus (18mm, 2.32 g, 4h). Contemporary imitation(?). 
Uncertain mint in Gaul. IMIP (sic) TETRICVS AVG, radiate and draped bust right / C PIE TVS A I, Pietas standing facing, 
head left, holding long scepter. Apparently unpublished, but cf. RIC V 231, 236, 246, 250, and 253 for similar obverses naming 
Tetricus II as Augustus. Near EF, attractive brown surfaces. Extremely rare. 
($300) 

There is uncertainty whether Tetricus I elevated his son, Tetricus II, from Caesar to emperor in the final days of their reign in AD 274. A coin 
identified by Sutherland (&quot;An Unpublished Coin in the Name of Tetricus II,&quot; MN XI [1964]) purports to be of Tetricus II as Augustus, but 
the authenticity of the coin, or whether it is a blundered imitation, is debatable. The present coin may be from the huge issues of barbarous 
radiates that were struck in Gaul and Britain in the late 3rd century and later. Although the issuers of these coins attempted to imitate authentic 
issues, a large portion are erroneous, most commonly as hybrids of obverses of one of the Tetrici appearing with reverses of the other. While 
the present coin has the obverse bust of Tetricus II, the legend may have been confused with that of Tetricus I. Regardless, the appearance of 
AVG on any coin of Tetricus II, official or barbarous, is extremely rare.

RIC notes that although no argentei were apparently authorized for this period at Antioch, a single specimen of Galerius Augustus was issued 
with the same type and mintmark as the present coin, and was considered to have been struck &quot;beyond official instructions.&quot; The present piece 
suggests that a short-lived official issue of argentei was, in fact, struck at the mint before the series was concluded.

L. Domitius Alexander led a short-lived revolt against Maxentius from AD 308 to 311, holding Africa and Sardinia. There is little known about 
this usurper, but there is evidence in an inscription (CIL VIII, 22183) that he and Constantine allied themselves in opposition to Maxentius. 
P. Salama in &quot;Recherches numismatiques sur l&apos;usurpateur africain L. Domitius Alexander,&quot; Proceedings of the International Numismatic 
Congress 1973, p. 365, note 2, suggests that at the latest, the pact was entered into by autumn of 310. The coins of the usurper Alexander are 
quite rare, particularly those with the star in the mintmark, as here. Salama speculated that this might have indicated a second emission that 
was cut short by the death of Alexander, or a parallel emission. The lack of diversity of types under this mintmark, three compared to twelve 
on coins without the star, suggests that it is more likely a second, rather than parallel, emission. In total, Salama noted only seven authentic 
examples with this mintmark. There are three specimens, including this coin, in CoinArchives.

BYZANTINE COINAGE 

1029. 
Justin I. 518-527. Iron Die for an AE Follis Reverse. Average dimensions: overall length, 88mm; diameter, 35mm at 
die face, widening to 40 mm at the center, and tapering to 33mm at striking face. Of octagonal form. Weight: 790 gm. Reverse 
of a third officina Nicomedia mint follis of Justin I: Large M, cross above; star to either side; Γ//NIKM (SB 83). M.D. O&apos;Hara, 
&quot;A Unique Byzantine Coin Die of Justin I (AD 518-27),&quot; Minerva XII/5 (September/October 2001), p. 54 (this die). As made, 
shank rusted and pitted. The only extant Byzantine coin die known. 
($10,000) 

Ex Triton V (16 January 2002), lot 2253. 

The only officina letters recorded in the various national collections and in the standard works for this variety with NIKM are A, B, Δ and 
Є, the first, second, fourth and fifth workshops the third workshop represented by the letter Γ has so far only been noted for this variety with 
NIKOM (SB 83B). This may go some way to suggesting that some event, administrative or otherwise, could account for the fact that this die 
somehow escaped destruction. 

Iron dies are by their very nature a rare and valuable commodity and, in most cases, they would have been melted down and reused. There 
are only about a hundred Roman dies extant, mainly of the first century (bronze or iron). For the one thousand years of the Byzantine Empire 
this is the first and only die to have come to light (there are, however, rare tongs known for making lead seals but no actual coin dies). This 
spectacular discovery of a very large early Byzantine coin-die is of major numismatic importance and of the highest rarity, and it is of the 
greatest interest since it allows an unprecedented glimpse behind the scenes of coin production.

Beginning in 608, the exarch of Africa and his son, both named Heraclius, began issuing coinage in opposition to that of the unpopular 
Byzantine emperor Phocas. This coinage named and depicted the Heraclii as consuls (though neither held the title at that time) rather than as 
emperors, a political move that promoted the Heraclii as champions of the people, not merely rivals to the throne. The revolt culminated with 
Heraclius the younger&apos;s coup at Constantinople in 610, where he was welcomed by the population, crowned, and saw to the execution of his 
predecessor. The solidi dated to indictional year 13 constitute the final gold issue of the revolt.

The powerful personality of Irene had always overshadowed that of her son Constantine, and only an army mutiny had prevented her from 
taking power in 790. After a short period in exile, she returned to Constantinople, and began plans to eliminate her enemies. As the coinage 
shows, she quickly relegated her son to second place. By 797, she had discredited Constantine to the point that she could have him deposed, 
blinded, and murdered with little outcry. A conspiracy of the patricians led to her being deposed in 802. She was exiled to Lesbos, where she 
died the following year.

neither of which markers are found on official issues of this mint, would suggest that this is an unofficial imitation, struck locally by one of

Jerusalem Pilgrim Coinage 

1068. 
CRUSADERS, Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem. Jerusalem Pilgrim Coinage. 12th century. BI Denier (18mm, 
0.82 g, 3h). ส ˟Ƀ ⌉ï⌉ዩየ⌉, cross pattée / Medieval façade of the al-Aqsa Mosque: façade with three arched entries; above; 
central pedimented tower surmounted by cross; on either side, sphere surmounted by pellet-in-crescent. Metcalf, Crusades, pp. 
78-9; Schlumberger -; Seltman, Coins, fig. 1-2; Slocum 284 var. (obv. legend); CCS 49. VF, toned, some porosity. Extremely 
rare, five examples noted by Seltman, none in CoinArchives. 
($5000) 

Associated with the pilgrim traffic in Jerusalem and the Crusaders, especially the Knights Templar, who oversaw the local Christian holy 
sites there, this extremely rare denier most likely served as a token coinage used specifically on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. The obverse 
legend, here crudely rendered, referred to the s(a)n(cta) aerea, or &quot;holy area&quot;, which was the Haram esh-Sharif, or Temple Mount. At the time, 
this area was dominated by three Umayyad structures: the Qubbat al-Sakhrah, or Dome of the Rock; the Qubbat al-Silsilah, or Dome of the 
Chain; and the al-Masjid al-&apos;Aqṣā, or the al-Aqsa Mosque. It is this last structure that is represented on the reverse of this denier. Following 
the capture of Jerusalem in 1099, the mosque was renamed as the Templum Solomonis, or Solomon&apos;s Temple, to distinguish it from the 
Dome of the Rock, now known as the Templum Domini, or Lord&apos;s Temple. First converted into a palace and stable, the al-Aqsa Mosque was 
transformed in 1119 into the headquarters of the Pauperes commilitones Christi Templique Salomonici, or Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and 
of the Temple of Solomon. More commonly known as the Knights Templar, they were a Christian military order, their mission, as stated by the 
Order&apos;s founder, Godfrey de Saint-Omer, was to provide protection for Christian pilgrims on their journey in the Holy Land. Initially, a very 
poor order, who relied largely on donations, the Templars soon grew to be a wealthy and powerful organization, largely through the advocacy 
of St. Bernard of Clairvaux. Within a decade of their founding, the Templars became a favored charity throughout Christendom and, by papal 
bull, could cross its borders unhindered and were exempted by papal bull from taxation and all authority except that of the Pope. When the 
Muslims under Saladin retook Jerusalem in 1187, following the Battle of Hattin, the Templars were force to evacuate their headquarters on 
the Temple Mount and flee to relocate northward. This withdrawal initiated the loss of Templar control in the Holy Land and their eventual 
destruction by Pope Clement IV and the French king, Philip IV, in 1307.

An Arab-Sassanian coin with a refined aesthetic style. The Islamic inscription on the obverse is laid out radially, rather than lengthways as it 
was more commonly the case, creating an extremely elegant composition. This rare piece demonstrates the efforts of al-Hajjaj and the caliph 
Abd al-Malik to create original coins, rather than just simple imitations.

This is the sole silver coin type bearing the name of Chingiz Khan. It was apparently a long-lived issue, evidenced by a declining silver quality, 
from fine silver to nearly bronze. Good silver issues, as the present coin, are fairly rare. The obverse has the titles and name of Chingiz, while 
the reverse has the name and title of the reigning Abbasid caliph. The striking date of this issue is based on SICA 9, with the commentary that 
these coins are &quot;believed to have been struck at Ghazna during the Mongol pursuit of Jalal al-Din Khwarizmshah in [AH] 617-618.&quot;

Bob Lyall (&quot;Gibraltar Hearts,&quot; in NumCirc XCV.6 [December 2007], p. 306-308) reattributes the Type I and II heart-shaped cut coins, 
previously assigned to Dominica or Martinique, to the British possession of Gibraltar. Two particular pieces of textual evidence inform 
this reattribution -a 1748 first-hand account of circulating silver coins with a heart shaped bit removed, and a 1749 order prohibiting the 
circulation of cut or damaged Spanish coins. Lyall also noted that the dates appearing on the Type III and IV issues are too late for the same 
attribution to Gibraltar, and the author initially confirmed their attribution to Dominica. Private communication with the author indicates that 
newly uncovered documentary evidence suggests these later types were also struck in Gibraltar circa 1760.

A member of the Mamluk, or Ghulam, Dynasty of Delhi, Shams-ud-din Iltutmish is considered to be the founder of the Delhi Sultanate in 
1211, because he consolidated that state&apos;s position in India. Receiving the Caliph&apos;s investiture in his position, Iltimush expanded his power 
by bringing several neighboring territories, among them Bengal, under the authority of Delhi. Following the murder of the ever-mad &apos;Ali-yi 
Mardan in AH 609 (AD 1212/13), he was succeeded by Husam al-Din &apos;Iwad. Styling himself as Sultan Ghiyath al-Din &apos;Iwad, he soon lost 
the important territory of Bihar to Iltutmish, but prevented further invasion by offering tribute and recognition of Delhi overlordship. Soon, 
afterward, however, &apos;Iwad reneged on his agreement with Iltutmish, who sent his son, Nasir al-Din Mahmud, to invade Bengal. Following 
&apos;Iwad&apos;s defeat and execution in 1227, Nasir al-Din Mahmud was appointed as his father&apos;s viceroy in Bengal.

Ex Classical Numismatic Group 102 (18 May 2016), lot 1310. 

The reverse of the Berlin example, lacking the shroff marks of our coin, reveals that the die was dated RY 13 -located below the word nur 
and with the number 3 almost completely obliterated by a shroff mark. This die was paired with an Agra mint obverse die (cf. Triton XIX, lot 
2399) to strike this extremely rare mohur. The two known examples are struck from two obverse and one reverse dies. 

Owing to an epidemic of plague in Agra, Jahangir encamped at Fatehpur during AH 1028 (see S.H. Hodivala, &quot;The Chronology of the Zodiacal 
Coins of Jahangir&quot;, NC 1929, p. 306). As recounted in his autobiography, the Tuzuk-e Jahangiri, Jahangir entered Fatehpur on the 28th Di, 
RY 13 (18 January, AD 1619) and remained there until 31 Farwardin, RY 14 (20/1 April, AD 1619). According to the Solar Hijri calendar, 
four zodiacal signs cover the period during which Jahangir resided in Fatehpur. The last of these, Varak/Mesha (Aries the Ram), refers to the 
month of Farwardin, enabling us to date this coin to that month. Given that the obverse corresponds with the month of Jahangir&apos;s departure 
from Fatehpur, and the extreme rarity of this mohur type from that mint, it is quite possible that these coins were struck in conjunction with the 
emperor&apos;s departure from Fatehpur, and were presented to those members of the local elite who had accommodated Jahangir during his stay.

Frederick II Hohenstaufen, &quot;Stupor Mundi&quot; (&quot;Wonder of the World&quot;), was the most enlightened ruler of the medieval European world, and 
single-handedly almost ignited a renaissance a century before it took hold in western Europe. Besides encouraging the study of both the 
ancient and natural worlds (he wrote an insightful treatise on falconry), Frederick was instrumental in improving relations with the Muslims, 
negotiating free access to Christian holy sites in Palestine, where all Crusader armies had been unsuccessful. One of his innovations was a 
gold coinage comparable in style and quality to the gold of the ancient Caesars. The classical motifs proclaimed his inheritance of the legacy 
of Rome, and the augustale and its fractions were issued concurrently with the publication of the Constitution of Melfi, his codification of 
Norman law meant to follow the famous Roman law codes. These coins were struck until Frederick&apos;s death in 1250, and may have been 
continued by his successors for about another fifteen years.

Zamosc was the site of a major series of fortifications in southeastern Poland. The forts were twice besieged during the Napoleonic Wars, once 
in 1809, when forces of the Duchy of Warsaw encircled and defeated the Austrian defenders, and again in 1813, by the Russians. Following the 
disastrous retreat of the French Army from Moscow, troops under General Rath moved west, laying siege to the forts at Zamosc in February 
of 1813. The Polish defenders held out for nine months before ultimately capitulating in mid-November. Silver and copper coins were struck 
during the later siege, with copper obtained from circulating Austrian coinage, and silver from a local Franciscan monastery. The coins were 
recalled and melted by Russian authorities after the fall of the fort.

falcon left. Gomes 08.01 (example without c/m); cf. Vaz An.15-16 (for type). Good VF, toned. Well struck countermark. 
Extremely rare. 
($2000) 

The countermark on this tostão is a falcon -açor in Portuguese -which became a badge of the Azores. Initially, the falcon was the mintmark 
of the Angra do Heroísmo mint. Later, it was used as a countermark to indicate that Portuguese coinage struck outside of the Azores was valid 
for circulation there. 

In 1580, Henrique I died without naming a successor. A struggle followed in which three contestants vied for the throne: Catarina, infanta de 
Portugal, duquesa de Bragança; Felippe II of Spain; and António I o Prior do Crato. Using the hatred of the Spanish, Antonio was chosen and 
proclaimed king by popular acclamation in July 1580. His reign, however, lasted only twenty days. Defeated by the Spanish at the Battle of 
Alcântara, he fled to the Azores, from where he attempted to rule Portugal as an opposition government unrecognized everywhere but in the 
Azores. Eventually, Antonio made his way to France and England, where it was hoped that his return to Portugal would spark uprisings there 
against Felippe II. Unsuccessful, António ended his days in France on a small pension.

Peninsular War-Related Issue 

1168. 
SPAIN, Reino de España. Fernando VII. Prisoniero, 1808-1814. AR 5 Pesetas (41mm, 26.80 g, 12h). Lérida 
(Lleida) mint. Dated 1809. Draped bust right; flower below bust / Crowned coat-of-arms. ME 15800; NE 494; KM 11. VF, 
toned, typical crude strike. Extremely rare. 
($3000) 

This coin, struck in the name of King Fernando VII of Spain by his supporters at Lérida in western Cataluña, was produced during the 
opening of the Peninsular War (1808-1814). This conflict, one of many fronts in the Napoleonic Wars, pitted the French Empire against Spain, 
Portugal, and Great Britain in a struggle to maintain control of the Iberian peninsula. Beginning in 1807, agents of the French government 
became involved in Spanish politics. They exploited squabbles among the Spanish royal family, which helped to further weaken the already 
disorganized Spanish military and government. In addition, Spain and France were jointly occupying Portugal during this period. As a pretext 
to send French soldiers into Spanish territory, Napoleon decided to reinforce his garrisons in Portugal. The Spanish, who had a treaty with 
France, did not refuse this increase in troop levels. By February of 1808, Napoleon had enough soldiers in place to reveal his true intention -
the occupation of Spain. By the time the Spanish realized the subterfuge, the French were powerful enough to take many cities. With their lack 
of organization, the Spanish military could not mount a defense. Its troops were spread throughout the country. The reigning monarch, Carlos 
IV, was forced to abdicate on 19 March 1808, in favor of his son, who became Fernando VII. Almost two months later, Fernando was himself 
forced to abdicate, spending the next six years as a prisoner in France. In his place, Napoleon installed his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as king 
of Spain. Uprisings against the Bonaparte pretender soon broke out across the country with provincial juntas forming in regions opposed to 
the new rule. Among those supporting the imprisoned Fernando VII was the garrison at Lérida. From 23 April and 29 April to 14 May 1810, 
the garrison, under the command of Jaime García Conde, was besieged by the French forces of Louis-Gabriel Suchet, one of Napoleon&apos;s most 
brilliant generals. After a brutal siege, which included the use of heavy artillery against which Lérida was ill-equipped, the city surrendered, 
netting the French six generals, 307 officers, and 105 artillery pieces as a result.

Early Scandinavian &amp; Swedish 

1169. 
SCANDINAVIA. Circa 991-1020. AR Penny (19mm, 1.40 g, 3h). Imitation of a AEthelred II Long Cross type of the 
Winchester mint; Brihtsige, moneyer. Draped bust left / Voided long cross with triple-crescent ends and pellet at center; all 
over quatrefoil. Malmer -. Good VF, peck marks. 
($750) 

This enigmatic coin features a highly atypical style, including misspellings, unusual letter forms, and a generally misshapen bust and face, 
all of which preclude it from being an official issue of the well-studied Winchester mint. Thus, it must be an imitation, almost certainly from 
outside of England. The aforementioned individual features differ from those of the main groups of Irish and Scandinavian coinage, so the 
true source of this piece must remain a mystery. It is retained here under Scandinavia for convenience. 

New Obverse Die for Malmer Chain 105 

1170.

triple-crescent ends. Malmer chain 105, dies -/1206 (unlisted obv. die). Good VF, toned.

transported to Scandinavia). Good VF, wavy flan. Rare. 
($500) 

Coins from this rare die chain link both to pieces in the English series and to pieces struck on square flans, a hallmark of Scandinavian minting. 
This fact, combined with their presence in the Skovvang hoard, strongly suggests a Scandinavian origin for these coins. Malmer suggests 
a minting location of Sigtuna, and reconstructs the travels of the series: &quot;A few years after dies 1715 and 1738 were made in England they 
were transported, perhaps via Lund, to Sigtuna where they were used to strike both round and square coins. Some of these coins were then 
traqnsported to Bornholm.&quot; (Malmer p. 52)

This celebrated medal is most frequently encountered in French re-strikes made from the 18th Century onward (see Eimer 31c). Contemporary 
cast examples are extremely rare, especially so in silver. 

To complement his handsome portrait of Julius III on the obverse, Cavino took as his model for the reverse a very rare sestertius of Vespasian; 
&apos;Roma Resurges&apos; RIC ii, 2nd ed., 109. Cavino made struck copies (Paduans) of this sestertius, see Klawans 3-4. On the medal he added more 
participants to the scene. Pope Julius, who takes the place of Vespasian on the sestertius, raises England, who replaces Roma, to her feet. 
Cardinal Pole and the Emperor Charles V, substituted by Cavino for Minerva, accompany England. Behind the Pope stand Philip and Mary 
facing one another. Mary is clutching her stomach that appears swollen. This has been interpreted as alluding to the pregnancy that Mary 
announced in November of 1554. This was the same month Cardinal Pole came to London and the formalities of reconciliation with the Holy 
See were concluded in the English Parliament. Had a child been born and survived, English and European history would have taken a very 
different course, but tragically for Mary it was a phantom pregnancy.

Ex Richard Cyril Lockett Collection (English Part I, Glendining, 6 June 1955), lot 686 (part of); Sir John Evans Collection. 

In his study and corpus of the Watchet mint, Mark Blackburn demonstrated that there was sudden cessation of coin production very early in 
the issue of the Crux type. This coin was one of only six Crux type pennies recorded, all struck from the same pair of dies. Remarkably, the 
reverse die would have a second life across the Irish Sea where it was used with an obverse die in the name of Sihtric Silkbeard, the Hiberno-
Norse king of Dublin (SCBI 32 Ulster 9). The Anglo Saxon Chronicle records Viking raids on Watchet in circa 988 and again in 997. However, 
these dates are not easily reconciled with the interruption of output and the reverse die may have made its way to Dublin by another route 

The Viking Attack on Huntingdon

Eaglen&apos;s detailed study notes a number of irregularities in the Helmet coinage of Huntingdon -&quot;obverses passed from moneyer to moneyer, 
or mint to mint, the loan of a moneyer, and very light coins.&quot; He suggests the possibility that these unusual events were a result of a Viking 
attack on the city in 1010. This would, however, necessitate the updating of the Helmet type from 1003-1009 to 1003-circa 1010.

realized £8). 

The attribution of this coin to a particular mint has caused much consternation. Early sales tentatively attributed the coin to the Huntingdon 
mint, while F. Elmore-Jones, in his 1957 study of the Awbridge type, declared that the coin to be &quot;irregular&quot; and of crude work or false dies. 
Later, E. J. Harris, in his article on the moneyers of the Normans in SCMB 796 (December 1984), read the moneyer as Asebi, and listed it under 
the Huntingdon mint (pp. 315-6, Huntington note f), without question. R. J. Eaglen, in his study of the Huntingdon mint, though, doubted the 
reading of the moneyer, although he still retains it as a product of that mint. Most recently, M. Allen revised the attribution, noting the obverse 
was an apparently normal die of London, but combined with a reverse that has an &apos;enigmatic&apos; legend, where the Ḧ ⌦ normally preceding ѝnē 
was omitted.

Following the increase in racial and religious discrimination against the native Irish population during the first third of the seventeenth century, 
an open rebellion exploded in October 1641, when two Protestant members of the Lord Justices of Ireland prevented the Irish Parliament from 
passing a bill to alleviate Catholic grievances. While the rebels failed to seize Dublin Castle, which was one of their initial objectives, they 
quickly found success in Ulster province, from where the rebellion spread to the countryside. Following the outbreak of civil war between 
Charles I and the English Parliament the next year in 1642, the Irish Catholic rebels gave their support to the King, further placing them at 
odds with the English Protestants. 

Several emergency issues of coinage were struck during the early years of this rebellion. Among them was this crown, part of an issue 
commonly known as &quot;Ormond&quot; money, because it was erroneously believed to have been struck by James Butler, Marquis of Ormond, who 
led the Royalist forces in Ireland and was appointed Lord Lieutenant by Charles in November 1643. More accurately, this issue (like the so-
called &quot;Inchiquin Money&quot;) was struck by the Lord Justices, who served as the royal executive in Ireland.

The War of the Spanish Succession, sparked by Louis XIV of France in his attempts to expand his hegemony, flared into a continent-wide 
conflict, with France, Spain, and Bavaria opposed by a coalition centered around England, Holland, and Austria. One aim of the Allies was to 
deprive Spain of the wealth derived from its American colonies. When Admiral Sir George Rooke, commander of the combined fleet, learned 
the 1702 treasure had arrived at Vigo Bay in Spain, he resolved to seize it. His force of fifty ships besieged the harbor, destroying the French 
fleet guarding the convoy, sinking most of the ships and capturing cargo worth some 2 million pounds at the time. A special issue of gold and 
silver coins was struck from the captured plate and a number of medals honored the great victory.
