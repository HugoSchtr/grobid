AUCTION TERMS 

All written, fax, email and phone bids must be received by 5PM (ET) October 6, 2015. 

The Electronic Close starts at 9AM ET on October 7, 2015. Lots close every 15 seconds. 

To participate in this sale electronically you must be registered and approved to bid on www.cngcoins.com. 

Please read the auction terms for new information regarding bidding, buyer&apos;s fees, and payment of invoices. 

This is an internet and mail bid sale with an automated electronic close, con-
ducted by Classical Numismatic Group, Inc. (CNG). Bidding in the auction 
constitutes acceptance of the following terms: 

1. The property listed in this catalogue is offered for sale by CNG for itself 
and as agent for various owners and other consignors. We reserve the right 
to reject any bid, to determine the opening price, to set bidding increments, 
to vary the order of the auction, to reopen bidding in the case of a dispute, to 
withdraw any lot, to bid on behalf of CNG, to bid on behalf of the consignor, 
and to permit the consignor to bid on his own lots. CNG may loan or advance 
money to consignors or prospective bidders, and may have an interest other 
than commission charges in any lot. CNG may bid on its own account as an 
&quot;insider&quot; with information not available to the public. 

2. Lots will be sold in the order listed in the catalogue. The first lot will 
close electronically at www.cngcoins.com at 9AM Eastern Time on the sale 
date, with subsequent lots closing every 15 seconds thereafter. All written, 
fax, email and phone bids must be received by 5PM Eastern Time, on the day 
prior to the sale date. Electronic bids may be placed by approved bidders up 
until the closing time of each lot. The electronic clock on the website represents 
the official closing time for each lot. Bidders intending to bid electronically 
must first register at www.cngcoins.com. New website registrations are pro-
cessed for approval Monday through Friday 9AM-5PM Eastern Time only. No 
new registrations will be approved on the sale date. 

3. A 20% Buyer&apos;s Fee will be added to the hammer price of all success-
ful written, fax, email and phone bids. A 17.5% Buyer&apos;s Fee will be added 
to the hammer price of all successful electronic bids directly placed on www. 
cngcoins.com. 

4. All coins are guaranteed genuine. Attribution, date, condition and other 
descriptions are the opinion of the cataloguer, and no warranty is expressed 
or implied. Please note that an auction sale is not an approval sale. Lots 
examined prior to the sale and lots purchased by floor bidders (including bid-
ders executing commission bids on behalf of other parties) may not be returned 
for any reason except lack of authenticity. All claims of misdescription and all 
claims of return, except claims regarding authenticity, must be made within 5 
days of receipt of material. Any claim of lack of authenticity must be made 
in writing by the original purchaser immediately after discovery that an item 
is not authentic, and upon making such a claim the original purchaser must 
immediately return the lot to CNG in the same condition as at the time of the 
auction. Coins that have been encapsulated (&quot;slabbed&quot;) by a grading and/or 
authentication service may not be returned for any reason, including authen-
ticity, if they have been removed from the encapsulation (&quot;slab&quot;). If payment 
is made by credit card, rights of return are governed by these Auction Terms 
which supercede any rights of return promulgated by the card issuer. Estimates 
are intended as a guide only and not as a statement of opinion of value. 

5. Invoices are due and payable immediately upon receipt. Interest and late 
fees of 2.0% per month, or at the highest rate permitted by law, whichever 
is less, from the date of the auction, shall be payable on invoices not settled 
within 30 days of the auction date. Payment may be made by check or bank 
wire. Credit cards (Visa or MasterCard) will be accepted; credit card payments 
will not be accepted more than 14 days after the sale date. Payment by check 
must be made in either US dollars ($) drawn on a US bank or British sterling 
(£) drawn on a British bank. All successful bidders outside North America and 
the United Kingdom will be charged an additional $20 fee for bank charges 
that are the result of international wire transfer fees; this fee will be deducted 
for credit card or check payment as described above. CNG may reduce or 
compromise any charge or fee at its discretion. 

6. Bidders not known to us must provide satisfactory credit references or 
pay a deposit as determined at CNG&apos;s discretion before bidding. Minors are 
not permitted to bid without written consent of a parent guaranteeing payment. 
CNG may require payment in full from any bidder prior to delivery of lots. 
Title does not pass until lots are paid in full. Upon receipt of lots, the buyer 
assumes full responsibility for loss or damage. Delivery to the buyer&apos;s address 
of record shall constitute receipt by the buyer regardless of the identity of the 
person accepting delivery. 

7. Estimates are in U.S. dollars ($) and bids must be made in even dollar 
($) amounts. The CNG website, www.cngcoins.com, will execute electronic 
bids on behalf of all electronic bidders. Subject to reserves and opening prices, 
all electronic bids will be executed by the electronic software at one bidding 
increment (approximately 10%) over the next highest bid. All written, fax, 
email and phone bids received before 5PM the day prior to the sale date will be 
uploaded to the CNG website no later than the day prior to the sale date. These 
bids will not be subject to the minimum required bid cited on the website at 
the time of the upload. Any written, fax, email and phone bids received after 
the deadline or with special instructions will be executed at CNG&apos;s complete 
discretion and will be subject to the next bid required by the website. In the 
case of identical written, fax, email and phone bids, the earliest bid received 
wins. An electronic bid has priority over any identical written, fax, email or 
phone bid. Bid by lot number. No lot will be broken. Bidders are responsible 
for errors in bidding. Check your bids carefully. Electronic bidders may check 
their bids under User Services at www.cngcoins.com. 

8. A word on Reserves. CNG may place a reserve on any lot. However, no 
reserve will be higher than the estimate, and ordinarily lots are reserved at 60% 
of estimate. 

9. Bidders personally guarantee payment for their successful bids, including 
bidders executing commission bids from other parties and bidders representing 
corporations or other entities. Buyers accepting commission bids from other 
parties do so at their own risk and remain responsible for payment under these 
Auction Terms. 

10. In the event a successful bidder fails to make full payment within 30 
days of the auction date, CNG reserves the right to deem the sale incomplete 
and to resell the material, and the bidder agrees to pay for the reasonable cost 
of such a sale and also to pay any difference between the resale price and the 
previously successful bid. CNG reserves all rights that it is entitled to under 
the Pennsylvania Uniform Commercial Code, including the right to offset any 
sums due from a successful bidder against any future consignment or purchase 
or monies or goods in possession of CNG. 

11. Sales tax, postage, handling and insurance are the responsibility of the 
buyer and are added to all invoices where appropriate. For buyers in the 
European Union, CNG may import lots into the United Kingdom prior to 
shipment and charge buyers the import Value Added Tax. On any tax not paid 
by the purchaser which should have been paid, even if not invoiced by CNG, 
the purchaser agrees to pay the same on demand together with any interest or 
penalty that may be assessed. It is the responsibility of the buyer to comply 
with foreign customs and other regulations. 

12. Prices realized are published and are mailed with CNG&apos;s next publica-
tion. Prices realized are posted at www.cngcoins.com and successful electronic 
bidders are notified by email after the last lot of the sale closes. 

13. Bidders hereby waive any claim for incidental, consequential or exem-
plary damages arising from this auction. The sole remedy that any participant 
in the auction shall have for any claim or controversy arising out of the auction 
shall be a refund, without interest, of all or part of the purchase price paid by 
the participant. 

14. All rights granted by CNG or otherwise available to bidders and pur-
chasers, under these Auction Terms or otherwise, are personal and may not 
be assigned or transferred to any other person or entity, whether by operation 
of law or otherwise. No third party may rely on any benefit or right conferred 
by these Auction Terms. Bidders acting as agents must disclose the agency in 
writing to CNG prior to the auction; otherwise rights are limited to the agent 
and are not transferable to the undisclosed principal. 

15. Any dispute regarding this auction shall be governed by the laws of 
Pennsylvania and shall be adjudicated only by the Lancaster County Court 
of Common Pleas or the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of 
Pennsylvania; all bidders submit themselves to the personal jurisdiction of 
these courts for this purpose, consent to service of process by registered or 
certified mail, and waive any contrary provisions of Articles 14 or 15 of the 
French Civil Code and any similar provisions in any jurisdiction. All bidders 
consent to the confidentiality of consignors&apos; identities and waive any right to 
require disclosure of the name of the consignor or owner of any auction lot, 
whether such right is based on New York GOL  §5-701(a) or any other provi-
sion in any jurisdiction. In any dispute regarding this auction, the prevailing 
party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorney fees. </preface>

A Brief History of Classical Numismatic Group, Inc. 

On the Occasion of CNG&apos;s Auction 100 

The beginnings of Classical Numismatic Group can be traced back to the spring of 1975, when Victor England graduated from 
the University of Denver and decided to enter the rare coin business. Victor first pursued the path of dealing in United States, 
ancient, and world coins, but after attending a coin show in Biloxi, Mississippi, and realizing that his merchandise was about 
the same as every other dealer&apos;s, he decided to switch his focus entirely to ancient, medieval, and world coinage. He decided it 
was more fun to sell history than to argue about the nuances of grading U.S. coins. Victor England Ltd. was started in Denver, 
Colorado out of an office on South University Boulevard, not far from his alma mater. 

Victor almost immediately began publishing fixed price lists and mail 
bid auction sales, and by the time he published Volume II, No. 5, he 
had announced his relocation to San Francisco, California. Business 
was conducted out of Suite 717, at 500 Sansome Street, and soon 
Victor hired his first numismatic employee, Stephen M. Huston. After 
a crippling burglary in February of 1980 at the Sansome street office, 
Victor again relocated back to Denver. He reestablished his business in 
Denver during the summer of 1980, and would remain in the Denver 
area until the fall of 1983, when he decided to once again relocate, 
this time to Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, where his parents still 
lived and where Victor had attended high school before he left for the 
University of Denver back in 1971. Victor married in 1983, and he and 
Cathy decided that Lancaster County was the place to start their family. 

Victor purchased a home in the rural community of Quarryville, Pennsylvania, 
which would become the base of his operations for the next ten years. In 
1986, Victor decided to enter the competitive world of coin auctions. To that 
end, he hired Karen L. Zander to be his office manager, and formed Classical 
Numismatic Auctions, Ltd., which conducted its first auction on 1 May 1987 in 
New York City at the Sheraton Center Hotel &amp; Towers, familiar to many as the 
home of the New York International Numismatic Convention since the early 
1970s. The auctioneer for the first sale was Herbert J. Kreindler, a noted dealer 
in ancient coins, and this relationship with Herb has continued to this day. 
Other important influences on Victor&apos;s early career were Charles H. Wolfe, Sr., 
John Barton (Owl Ltd.), Thomas P. McKenna, and Joel Malter. 

Victor decided he needed help to continue the auction sales, and Kerry K. 
Wetterstrom joined the firm in time for the next sale held on 7 November 
1987, this time in conjunction with the Grand Central Coin Convention, 
held across the street from the Sheraton at the Omni Park Hotel. As the 
number of auctions increased, both public and mail bid only sales (yes, 
Virginia, this was before the Internet), additional employees were added: 
first Peter L. Lampinen in late 1989, and then Dawn Ahlgren in mid 1990. 

The next step in the evolution of what was to become CNG started with 
conversations at several coin shows in the late 1980s between Victor and 
Eric J. McFadden. Eric was based in Southern California; he had studied 
Classics at Pomona College and Oxford University (where he was president 
of the Oxford University Numismatic Society), and he had worked as a 
volunteer at the Getty Museum organizing the museum&apos;s coin collection. 
Eric then worked at Numismatic Fine Arts, Inc. in the late 1970&apos;s and early 
1980s. He left NFA to obtain his law degree from Harvard Law School, 
where he paid his expenses by dealing part-time in ancient coins. Eric 
continued to deal in ancient coins during his four years as an attorney, and 
eventually realized that he preferred the ancient coin field to a law career. 
In 1990, Victor and Eric decided to join forces as partners.

At this point, the company of Victor England Ltd. ceased to exist, and a new corporation was formed: Classical Numismatic 
Group with offices in Quarryville, Pennsylvania and Beverly Hills, California. Eric&apos;s tenure in Beverly Hills was to be short-
lived, however, as a new opportunity presented itself during COINEX, the annual London coin fair, in the autumn of 1990. 
An agreement was made whereby CNG purchased the rights to the numismatic business of the venerable London firm, B.A. 
Seaby Ltd. 

Effective in March of 1991, CNG took over the daily coin operations of Seaby, which at that time was located at 7 Davies 
Street just off Berkeley Square. It was soon decided that Eric would close the Beverly Hills office and relocate to London in 
order to manage the Seaby coin business for CNG. 

The purchase of Seaby Coins gave CNG a foothold in the European market, and Eric helped to establish Seaby/CNG as one of 
the leading firms in ancient, British, and world coinages in London. Eric will be observing his 25th year of managing CNG&apos;s 
London operations in 2016. 

Back stateside, CNG&apos;s U.S. business continued to grow, which prompted 
a move from the sleepy village of Quarryville to the larger community of 
Lancaster, Pennsylvania. A 19th century farmhouse was purchased in 1993, 
renovated, and the offices were moved there in January of 1994. Cathy 
England had joined the firm full-time in 1991, and the numismatic staff 
grew with the addition of Barry P. Murphy in January of 1992, and more 
office space (and bookshelf space!) was needed. 

As the firm continued to grow in the 1990s, CNG continued hiring and 
became a training ground for classical numismatists. As various staff 
members would leave to pursue other opportunities, others stepped in, and 
today, after 25 years since its founding, Classical Numismatic Group&apos;s list 
of alumni is impressive. 

In alphabetical order, the following numismatists have worked for the firm in the U.S.: Dr. Lawrence A. Adams, Benjamin R. 
Bell, Jeremy Bostwick, William A. Dalzell, A.J. Gatlin, Peter Lampinen, John C. Lavender, Ken McDevitt, David Michaels, 
Barry Murphy, Bradley Nelson, William B. Porter, Jeff Rill, Wayne G. Sayles, Col. Ted Schmidt, Scott VanHorn, Kerry 
Wetterstrom, and W. Jeffrey Winter. In the London office, the list 
includes: David Guest, Eugene Paunov, Bridget Roe, Julia Trocmé-
Latter, Max Tursi, and Italo Vecchi. Various numismatists have served 
as interns at CNG, including William A. Dalzell, Leif Davisson, Sam 
Spiegel, and Alex Steinmetz. 

The list of experts that CNG has consulted over the years is also 
impressive and includes (in alphabetical order): BCD, Catharine C. 
Lorber, William Metcalf, Wayne Moore, Y.T. Nercessian, Fred B. 
Shore, Dr. Gordon A. Singer, John Spring, Karl Stephens, David Vagi, 
and William B. Warden, Jr. CNG has conducted many joint auctions 
over the years with other leading firms, including: Harlan J. Berk, 
Ltd., Freeman &amp; Sear, Gitbud &amp; Naumann, Fritz Rudolf Künker 
GmbH &amp; Co KG, Numismatica Ars Classica (NAC) AG, Nomos AG, 
St. James&apos;s Auctions (Stephen Fenton), Karl Stephens, and M. Louis 
Teller &amp; Company. 

Over the years, CNG has been privileged to handle the sale of many important private collections, as well as museum 
consignments from institutions such as the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Phoenix Art Museum, the American Numismatic 
Society, the MoneyMuseum (Zürich), the Royal Ontario Museum, and the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. 

As the Internet and Digital Age evolved, CNG has taken full advantage of these new tools, and now has a major presence 
on the Internet through its website www.cngcoins.com. Today, in addition to our three printed auction catalogues per year, 
CNG has conducted over 350 biweekly electronic auctions on our website. Utilizing state-of-the-art digital photography, and 
the talents of our in-house photographers, Travis Markel and Jessica Garloff, and our research staff, CNG maintains a digital 
archive on its website under the &quot;RESEARCH&quot; banner, with access to our internal search engine including over 240,000 
items we have sold since we began archiving material on the web in 2000. This part of the site is freely accessible to everyone 
(without registration), and is used by collectors, dealers, and academics from around the world.

Over the last 25 years, CNG has also been active in 
the broader advancement of numismatics. CNG has 
published over 25 numismatic books, ranging from 
specialist studies to practical guides, including titles 
that have won major awards and several that are 
recognized as the standard references in their fields. 
In the U.S., CNG has worked with the American 
Numismatic Society in various endeavors, and in 2010 
the ANS presented Victor with the ANS Trustees&apos; 
Award and made him the honoree at the annual ANS 
gala. In 2015, the American Numismatic Association 
presented Victor with the Harry J. Forman Dealer of 
the Year Award. 

In the U.K., CNG has established the CNG Roman and Byzantine Fund, administered through the Royal Numismatic Society, 
to provide grants for the study of Roman and Byzantine Numismatics, and CNG sponsors the annual CNG Lecture at Oxford&apos;s 
Ashmolean Museum. Eric has been particularly active in the International Association of Professional Numismatists (IAPN), 
the international numismatic trade organization; he has served as president of the IAPN and continues to serve as the president 
of the IAPN&apos;s authentication bureau, the International Bureau for the Suppression of Counterfeit Coins (IBSCC). 

By 2008, CNG was once more in need of larger office quarters, so a new building was purchased, remodeled, and occupied 
by the summer. In London, Seaby/CNG relocated in the fall of 2014 from its long-time space on Old Bond Street to a new 
location at 20 Bloomsbury Street, near the British Museum. 

Today, as CNG celebrates 40 years in the numismatic trade (Victor 
England Ltd. -1975 to 1990; CNG Inc. -1990 to date), the company 
continues to grow and prosper. Victor England continues to manage the 
Lancaster office while Eric McFadden runs the office in London. Working 
with them is a team of experienced professional numismatists: Bradley 
Nelson-Senior Numismatist, Scott VanHorn, Jeff Rill, Ken McDevitt, 
Jeremy Bostwick, Bill Dalzell, and Kerry Wetterstrom in Lancaster and 
David Guest in London. Accounting, shipping, and general operations are 
handled by Cathy England, Karen Zander, Dawn Ahlgren, and Dale Tatro 
in Lancaster. Alexandra Spyra and Tina Jordan keep the London office 
running smoothly. CNG&apos;s Creative Arts Staff consists of Travis Markel 
and Jessica Garloff. CNG now sells over 20,000 coins annually, and over 
the past 10 years, we have sold more than $200 million dollars worth of 
coins at auction and set numerous price records.

By the middle of the 5th century BC, the situation in Sicily prefigured much later developments in Renaissance Italy, when local princes 
engaged in continual warfare among themselves, while employing the services of the finest contemporary artists and craftsmen. Wars required 
significant amounts of coinage to hire mercenaries, and the increasing cultural sophistication of the courts encouraged artistic experimentation 
-the result was the patronizing of some of the most talented coin engravers in history. In Syracuse and surrounding cities, the anonymous 
&quot;Demareteion Master&quot; and the &quot;Maestro della foglia&quot; were followed by their students and successors -Choirion, Euainetos, Eumenos, 
Exakestidas, Herakleidas -all of whom proudly signed their works. These masters developed new ways of viewing the world through art, 
breaking the static forms developed in Archaic and early Classical art, thereby developing new methods of portraying motion and life in 
miniature. The silver tetradrachm was the preferred denomination for such expression, providing a sufficient canvas upon which these artists 
had free-range to create. At Syracuse, these artists infused the standard typology -the victorious charioteer and the head of Arethousa -with 
a vigorous lifelike quality that places these coins among the finest works of numismatic art. The chariot scene was transformed from a two-
dimensional view to a dynamic three-dimensional perspective, with the horses arrayed in such a manner as to give the viewer the impression 
that the horses are emerging from the field. On the reverse, the previously stoic and sedate profile of Arethousa was now imbued with a certain 
individuality. Although her adornments varied in the way her hair was kept and the kind of earrings she wore, the vitality of her countenance 
now offered a radiant immortality.

Dionysios assumed power in 405 BC and immediately set out to make Syracuse the greatest and best fortified city in all of Greece. He was 
defending against the renewed imperialistic expansion of Carthage. Three times he defeated the Carthaginians, bringing further prestige and 
wealth to Syracuse. During his reign, the Syracuse navy became the most powerful in the Mediterranean, allowing Syracuse to expand her 
territorial control over much of southern Italy. 

Dionysios reintroduced the large and ostentatious silver dekadrachms, a denomination that had not been used in Syracuse since the issue 
of the Demareteion decades earlier. Dionysios entrusted two of the greatest local numismatic artists, Kimon and Euainetos, to design these 
impressive pieces. The regard for these coins in modern times is reflected by the fact that they are considered a must for any first rank 
collection of Greek coins.

($2500) 

The appearance of the royal title and the general style place this issue in the East, probably after Alexander&apos;s death. The eagle is directly 
reminiscent of the early &quot;eagle coinage&quot; of Alexander, but these issues likely ended well before the royal title was added to the coins, and 
were only produced at a mint in Macedon and probably Miletos. The eagle is a common symbol on staters of western Asia Minor (previously 
Salamis), but on those issues, the eagle is not looking back, nor is it standing on a thunderbolt. The symbol may have a Ptolemaic connection, 
as a similar eagle-on-thunderbolt is common on the satrapal tetradrachms of Ptolemy I. At the same time, this stater is probably not an issue 
of Memphis or Alexandreia, whose abundant Alexander-type staters were never inscribed with the royal title. Thus, if it is Ptolemaic, it must 
be an issue from one of their possessions in southern Asia Minor or the Levant.

In 373/2 BC, an earthquake destroyed the great Temple of Apollo at Delphi. Although reconstruction on the site commenced, the Phokian 
occupation of the sanctuary during the Sacred War of 355-346 BC prevented any full-scale work from occurring. In 338/6 BC, the Amphiktionic 
League decided to melt down the coinage comprising the temple treasury and mint a new series of coinage that would be used to finance a full 
reconstruction project. This new series comprised staters, drachms, and hemidrachms, whose types reflected the two sanctuaries controlled by 
the Amphiktionic League: the Temple of Apollo at Delphi and the Temple of Demeter at Anthela (near Thermopylai). The obverse of the staters 
depicts a left-facing head of Demeter, wearing a veil and grain-ear wreath in her traditional guise as the goddess of grain and fertility. On the 
reverse, Apollo is seated in a contemplative manner on an omphalos, holding a laurel branch and resting his elbow on a kithara. The omphalos, 
kithara, and laurel branch each recall a significant aspect of Apollo&apos;s mythology, with the omphalos signifying his oracular seat at Delphi, the 
kithara his dominion over music, and the laurel (ἡ δάφνη) his personal badge, the result of his unrequited love for the nymph Daphne.

lot 240; Sternberg VII (24 November 1977), lot 103. 

This issue had long been attributed to the island of Syros based on the reverse legend. Recent scholarship, however, has convincingly shown 
that this attribution is erroneous, as the reverse legend does not contain an ethnic, but names the type: the Divine Syrian Kaberioi. As the issue 
has long been linked to a rare portrait emission of Eumenes I with the same reverse type, it is clear that it must belong to a mint in the sphere of 
the kings of Pergamon. Although it is tempting to attribute it to the royal mint at Pergamon, this Attic-standard issue could have been struck at 
one of several mints under Attalid control. See A. Meadows, &quot;The Closed Currency System of the Attalid Kingdom&quot; in P. Thonemann, Attalid 
Asia Minor (Oxford, 2013), pp. 184-91 for the most current analysis of this intriguing coinage.

From the Friend of a Scholar Collection. Ex Leu 38 (13 May 1986), lot 110. 

This coin appears to belong to a diverse series of electrum staters struck on the Milesian standard that Kraay (ACGC p. 30), and others, have 
tentatively attributed to the period of the Ionian Revolt. Although none have ethnics, the obverses of many of the coins are of types that 
are common to various cities that were involved in the revolt. Kraay notes the significant problem with the theory is that there are none of 
these coins that feature a type that would be attributable to Miletos, the city that led the revolt, but he proposed that it was possible that the 
entire series was struck there, as a centralized mint. Thus the types could either represent the cities that contributed resources to the revolt or 
successive Milesian officials who oversaw the coinage production. If the obverse type does represent the city, this issue would most likely 
belong to Klazomenai, all of whose contemporary coinage featured a winged-boar forepart.

When the Pergamene king Attalos II died in 134 BC, he bequeathed his kingdom to the Romans. Because the Romans were slow in securing 
their claim, Aristonikos, son of the earlier Pergamene king Eumenes II, filled the power vacuum, claiming the throne and taking the dynastic 
name Eumenes. Although he was unable to capture Pergamon, his revolt lasted four years, until he was defeated and captured by the Romans 
under the consul M. Perperna. After his surrender, he was paraded through Rome and executed.

Ex Gorny &amp; Mosch 203 (5 March 2012), lot 197 (attributed to Naxos). 

In previous sales, this issue has been variously attributed to either Cycladic Naxos or Syros. While both cities struck coins with the same types 
as on this issue, all of these cities&apos; bronzes consistently bear the first two letters of their respective ethnic flanking the base of the kantharos. 
On this issue, however, these Greek letters have been replaced by two Lydian letters, allowing its correct attribution to a mint in Lydia. (CNG 
would like to thank Costas Kanellopoulos for correcting the prior attributions, and pointing out Vögtli&apos;s publication of this issue.)

($50,000) 

The &apos;Kroisos&apos; type coinage is one of the most recognizable of all ancient Greek coinage. All of the issues in the bimetallic, gold and silver, 
series feature the same confronted lion and bull foreparts on the obverse, and two incuse punches (or a single punch in the case of small 
denominations) on the reverse. It is thought that the series began on a &apos;heavy&apos; standard, with gold and silver staters of equal weight, around 
10.6-10.7 grams, which was later reduced to about 8.17 grams for the gold. More recently, though, studies have shown that coins of both 
standards circulated together, but that the heavy standard was only used for a relatively short time compared to the light standard, which 
continued to be used into the Persian period. The Kroiseids have also traditionally been broken down into two stylistic groups, &apos;realistic&apos; and 
&apos;stylized&apos;, with hoard evidence suggesting that the former belonged to the time of Kroisos, while the latter were of the time of the Persians. 
The present coin, however, is from an issue that constitutes a third group that has a more archaic style, which has features that suggest it is the 
first issue of Kroisos&apos; bimetallic coinage. 

This prototype issue was first noted and analyzed in an article by Paolo Naster in 1964 (&quot;Une série aberrante de Créséides&quot; in BSFN 19 
(1964), pp. 364-5, reprinted in P. Naster, Scripta Nummaria: Contributions à la méthodologie numismatique [Louvian-la-Neuve, 1983], pp. 
76-7). The archaic character of the type is most evident in the bull, where the fine waves of hair on the later coinage is here represented as 
a series of pelleted lines emanating from a solid arc that forms the animal&apos;s neckline. At the same time, antecedents of the style of the lion 
can be seen in the earlier electum coinage, particularly the hemihektai of Wiedauer&apos;s Group XVI. The most significant feature linking this 
issue to the electrum, though, is the appearance of the small pellet or protuberance on the head of the lion. This feature, usually featuring rays 
emanating from it, is canonical on all the earlier electrum coinage from the time of Ardys until the early part of Kroisos&apos; reign. It is a feature 
that is totally lacking on the bimetallic coinage of the &apos;realistic&apos; and, later, &apos;stylized&apos; character. A final unusual feature particular to this issue 
is the depiction of the arms of the lion and bull, which are shown bent nearly 90 degrees at their mid-point, rather than in a straight line from 
shoulder to paw and hoof. 

The extreme rarity today of these early style staters also suggests that the issue was short-lived, perhaps a trial run before the style was 
standardized. Martin Price also noted this unusual emission of staters (&quot;Croesus or Pseudo-Croesus?&quot; in Festschrift Mildenberg, p. 221, n. 
25), and, like Naster, placed them between the electrum and the gold of standard style.

The portraits on coins in the later Lycian series are among the finest of the Classical period. Among the earliest to attempt depictions of 
their rulers on coinage, the Lycians&apos; first portraits in the later 5th century BC were innovative, but static, idealized forms lacking individual 
characterization. Over the next half-century, however, the style progressed significantly toward realism, culminating in the issues of the 
dynasts Mithrapata and Perikles in the early-mid 4th century BC. The coins of Mithrapata came first, depicting on their reverse the profile 
portrait of a man with distinctive elderly features. Through the relative chronology established in L. Mildenberg&apos;s die study, one can even 
see the portrait become more aged as time progressed, reflecting the realism that had been captured in these issues. The coins of Perikles, 
Mithrapata&apos;s successor, continue this trend, but also have two innovations that set them at the pinnacle of classical portraiture. First, the 
portrait is moved to the obverse of the coin, emphasizing the importance of the individual. Second, and most prominently, the portrait is not 
in the traditional profile, but in a dramatic facing state. Obviously influenced by Kimon&apos;s facing Arethusa-head coinage at Syracuse, these 
depict Perikles looking out from the surface of the coin with a serene countenance and his hair flowing around him as if blown by the wind. 
This depiction captures the essence of the earlier idealized portraits, conveying to the viewer a sense that Perikles was more than a mere man, 
but retaining the realism in its individualized features. Interestingly, both Mithrapata and Perikles are depicted without any sort of satrapal 
headgear, which was always included in earlier Lycian portraits, perhaps indicating that they had declared their independence from the Persian 
king. Unfortunately, these astonishing developments in portraiture came to an abrupt end in Lycia when Maussollos of Caria invaded the 
region circa 360 BC.

Johnston has interpreted this remarkable reverse design as a relief map of the hinterland of Ephesos, which would make it the earliest Greek 
map and first physical relief map known. On the right (north) are the mountains Tmolos and Messogis between the river valleys of the Caÿster 
and Maeander, to the left of which are three mountain ridges (Madranbaba Dagi, Karincali Dagi, and Akaba Tepesi). Johnston follows Six in 
suggesting that the coins were probably struck under the Persian general Memnon at Ephesos, circa 336-334 BC, in order to pay his army after 
he had captured the city, but before his defeat by Alexander at the Battle of Granicus in 334. However, Johnston&apos;s theory has been the subject 
of some doubt, most notably by Leo Mildenberg. 

Alexander&apos;s Satrap of Mesopotamia

The Triton XVIII piece, from the same dies as this one, sold for $6500. 

Mazakes is best known as the Persian satrap who took over Egypt after Sabakes fell in battle against Alexander the Great&apos;s army at the 
Granicus, and later handed over the province peacefully to the Macedonian king. Imitative owls in the name of Mazakes have been known for 
some time, and all were originally attributed to his satrapy in Egypt. However, it was clear that stylistic elements separated the coinage into 
two general groups. More recent hoards, especially the 1973 Iraq hoard, have shown that one of the groups of imitative owls was certainly 
not struck in Egypt, but somewhere in the territory of modern day Iraq. In his analysis of the 1973 hoard, M. Price (&quot;Circulation at Babylon 
in 323 B.C.&quot; in W.E. Metcalf, ed., Mnemata: Papers in Memory of Nancy M. Waggoner [New York, 1991], pp. 63-72) changed the findspot 
from Iraq to the more specific cite of Babylon, based on anecdotal evidence (p. 63), and gave the series of Mazakes&apos; owls to the city. However, 
such an assignment has forced numismatists to conduct mental gymnastics in order to rationalize the presence of Mazakes&apos; coins at Babylon 
(cf. Van Alfen, Owls, pp. 27-33, and Le Rider, Alexander, pp. 215-7, for a summary of the previous research). 

It is clear that the attribution of the owls to Babylon is almost certainly incorrect, and other find evidence suggests an attribution to somewhere 
further north, perhaps in the satrapy of Mesopotamia (cf. Le Rider, op. cit., p. 217-9). In any event, this coinage clarifies the historical record 
regarding the disposition of Mazakes following his hand-over of Egypt, upon which subject the literary evidence is silent. As noted by Le 
Rider (op. cit., p. 215), one can compare Mazakes to other Persians who peacefully welcomed Alexander to their domains: Mazaios, who 
handed over Cilicia, was later made satrap in Babylon, and Mithrenes, who surrendered Sardes, was made satrap in Armenia. Also, the Persian 
noble Amminapes, who met Alexander in Egypt with Mazakes, was later made satrap of Parthia and Hyrkania. Thus, one would expect 
Mazakes to receive similarly favorable treatment, appointment to some position of authority. Interestingly, Mesopotamia is the only satrapy 
that is not addressed in the literary evidence when Alexander is organizing his eastern territories. As these tetradrachms of Mazakes are found 
in that region, and date to the period after Alexander&apos;s conquest, it is reasonable to suggest that Mazakes may have been appointed as satrap of 
Mesopotamia. It was also in the adjacent satrapy of Babylonia that Mazaios was allowed to strike a coinage in his name and types (influenced 
by his prior issues at Tarsos) for local use, and similar issues of local type and weight are known to have been issued at mints throughout the 
basin of the Tigris and Euphrates, from the time of Alexander to Seleukos I. Thus, these Athenian type tetradrachms likely constitute a local 
coinage of Mazakes, struck in the satrapy of Mesopotamia while he reigned there.

While the small d is commonly found on Ptolemy&apos;s obverse dies, the appearance of the ˚ is extremely rare. It is tempting to assume these are die

Mørkholm&apos;s study of the portrait coinage of Ptolemy V focused on the &quot;main series&quot;, which comprises a variety of issues from an uncertain 
military mint in Phoenicia during the Fifth Syrian War. In his die study, he noted that obverse die A6 of the uncertain mint was also known to 
have been used at the mint of Tyre. This coin presents a new obverse die link based on die A9 (see the following lot for an issue of the military 
mint struck with this die).

For almost fifty years Ptolemy&apos;s father, Juba II, maintained order in North Africa as one of Rome&apos;s most loyal client kings. He had been given 
Cleopatra&apos;s daughter, Cleopatra Selene, as a wife by a grateful Augustus, and their son Ptolemy succeeded Juba in AD 24. Ptolemy was not 
the strong leader his father had been, and increasing restiveness among the tribes led to the outbreak of several revolts, which he could not 
quell. Ptolemy was called to Rome for consultations in AD 40, where he was murdered by the unstable emperor Gaius Caligula. Mauritania 
was formally annexed to the empire in AD 44, and the revolts were brutally crushed by Roman legions. The death of Ptolemy marked the final 
end of the dynasty begun by his illustrious ancestor, Ptolemy I Soter.

($7500) 

From the Frank D. Arnold Collection. 

And now, tell me, O Muses that hold your mansions on Olympus, how fire was thrown upon the ships of the Achaeans. Hector came close up 
and let drive with his great sword at the ashen spear of Ajax. He cut it clean in two just behind where the point was fastened on to the shaft of 
the spear. Ajax, therefore, had now nothing but a headless spear, while the bronze point flew far away and came ringing down on to the ground. 
Ajax knew the hand of heaven in this, and was dismayed at seeing that Jove had left him utterly defenseless and was willing victory for the 
Trojans. Therefore he drew back, and the Trojans flung fire upon the ship which was at once wrapped in flame (Il. XVI.112-124). 

This episode in the Iliad describes a shift in the tide of war, when Zeus (Jove) bestows favor on Troy&apos;s prince and chief warrior, Hector, 
and rallies the Trojans. Hector has driven the Greeks back to their ships and is determined to burn them. Ajax, in one of the poem&apos;s more 
memorable moments, seemingly single-handedly defends the ships against the Trojan forces with &quot;a great sea-pike in his hands, twelve cubits 
long&quot; (XV.823-824). But by the time Hector arrives, Ajax is exhausted and the Trojan hero effortlessly strips him of his weapon. The Trojans 
burn one ship, but the fleet is saved when Patroclus takes to the battlefield disguised in the armor of Achilles, the most feared Greek warrior. 

Roman Ilium was raised over what was thought to be the location of Homeric Troy, a notion that has been confirmed by archaeological 
excavations of the site beginning with Heinrich Schliemann in 1868. The city&apos;s coinage is remarkable for its occasional reference to the Trojan 
War and its most famous hero. Hector appears on issues from the 1st century to the closing of the mint under Gallienus, but in most instances 
the coins feature motifs that may have had a precise meaning to Roman Ilium&apos;s citizens and tourists, but to us can only be interpreted as 
generic types (e.g., Hector in fighting stance; Hector in chariot). Much rarer are those remarkable coins honoring Hector that can be identified 
with a specific episode in Homer&apos;s epic poem, such as the hero vanquishing Patroclus or attempting to burn the Greek fleet. This latter type 
appears on a few, very rare earlier issues of Ilium, but was employed as a medallic type only for Valerian. Our medallion appears to be only the 
third known example of Bellinger T292 (the others in the Staatliche Münzsammlung, Munich and Yale University Art Museum, New Haven, 
the latter of which is fragmentary), and a unique reverse legend variant is also known (Bellinger T291, in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin). Thus 
the current medallion, which is the finest of the four, is the only example available to collectors.

Continued Herodian support of the Romans allowed the dynasty to extend its influence beyond Jewish territories. Herod V, the grandson 
of Herod the Great, was granted the kingdom of Chalcis by Claudius in 41 upon the request of Agrippa I, and all of his rare coins name the 
emperor. His friendship with and loyalty to the emperor continued to benefit him; following the death of Agrippa in 44, Claudius extended to 
him authority over affairs at the Temple in Jerusalem, a right he retained until his death some four years later.

some striking weakness. Extremely rare and unusual, and apparently an unpublished hybrid. 
($500) 

This unusual issue appears to have been struck at the beginning of Macrinus&apos; reign, as certain holdovers from Caracalla&apos;s reign are present, 
most notably in the portrait. Though the fullness of Caracalla&apos;s portrait has been replaced by the thinner style of Macrinus, the heavily 
furrowed brow and more lowly cropped beard of Caracalla is clearly visible. Additionally, the obverse legend contains the abbreviation for 
&apos;Aurelius,&apos; (the second instance of the AV) which was not a part of Macrinus&apos; name, and also switches the order of Opellius and Severus 
from their expected placement. Lastly, the reverse legend clearly ends with a &apos;Δ,&apos; a numeral letter which was never utilized, nor would make 
sense, for Macrinus&apos; reign. It was, however, the reading of the legend for the last series of Caracalla&apos;s tetradrachms, meaning that this likely 
represents a hybrid of types between the two emperors.

Allegorical Type Celebrating Tyre&apos;s Glassmaking Industry 

1752. 
PHOENICIA, Tyre. Philip I. AD 244-249. AE (28mm, 20.13 g, 6h). Laureate, draped, and cuirassed bust right / 
Personification of the Cendevian marshes standing facing, head left, holding long reed and pouring sand over dam; at feet, 
half-length figure of river-god Belus swimming left; murex in upper left field. Rouvier 2450; BMC -. VF, earthen green patina, 
light pitting on obverse. Extremely rare. 
($750) 

Tyre was famous for its purple die (extracted from the murex) as well as for its glassmaking, and Phoenicia itself was widely credited in 
antiquity as the birthplace of glass production. Although now known to be false, this sentiment was echoed as late as the seventh century AD 
by Isidore of Seville, at which time Tyre was still a major producer of glass: 

In a part of Syria which is called Phoenicia, there is a swamp close to Judaea, around the base of Mt. Carmel, from which the Bellus River 
arises...whose sands are purified from contamination by the torrent&apos;s flow. The story is that here a ship of natron [i.e., sodium carbonate] 
merchants had been shipwrecked; when they were scattered about on the shore preparing food and no stones were at hand for propping up 
their pots, they brought lumps of natron from the ship. The sand of the shore became mixed with the burning natron and translucent streams 
of a new liquid flowed forth: and this was the origin of glass. (Isidore of Seville, Etymologies XVI.16)

The Founding of Thebes

BЄ; murex shell to right. Rouvier 2500; BMC -. VF, dark green patina. Very rare and exceptional for issue. 
($1000) 

While travelling through Greece in search of his abducted sister Europa, the Phoenician prince Cadmus consulted the Delphic oracle, where 
he was instructed to follow a sacred cow and found a city on the spot where it should finally take rest. Cadmus followed the instructions, and 
the spot where the cow stopped became the great city of Thebes in Boeotia.

Cadmus Slays the Ismenian Serpent 

1757. 
PHOENICIA, Tyre. Valerian I. AD 253-260. AE (27mm, 10.83 g, 6h). Laureate, draped, and cuirassed bust right 
/ Cadmus standing right, nude but for billowing chlamys, about to hurl stone at the Ismenian Serpent; murex shell to left. 
Rouvier -; BMC -; AUB -; Lindgren II 2393 var. (bust type, murex shell between legs). VF, dark brown patina, earthen 
highlights. Rare. 
($500) 

The Ismenian Serpent or Ismenian Dragon was a giant creature that guarded the sacred spring of Ismenus in the vicinity of what would become 
Thebes. Cadmus encountered the monster, which was the offspring of Ares, while fetching water for a ritual related to the foundation of 
Thebes and slew it with a stone. Athena instructed the hero to sow the dragon&apos;s teeth in the earth, and a crop of armed warriors, called Spartoi, 
sprang up. Most of these warriors were killed by each other or by Cadmus in battle, but the five that survived -Echion, Udaeus, Chtonius, 
Hyperenor, and Pelor -became the ancestors of the Thebans. 

This type appears to be much more common for Gallienus (see Rouvier 2530-1, BMC 487, and AUB 300-1).

Three Important Herodian Issues 

The &quot;Great King&quot; Agrippa I -Proclaimed by Claudian Edict 

1759. 
JUDAEA, Herodians. Agrippa I, with Herod of Chalcis and Claudius. 37-43 CE. AE (25mm, 16.78 g, 6h). 
Caesarea Maritima mint. Dated RY 8 of Agrippa I (43 CE). [BAΣ AΓPIΠΠAΣ ΣEB KAIΣAP BAΣ HPΩΔHΣ] (King 
Agrippa, Augustus Caesar, King Herod), Claudius, togate, standing left, sacrificing from patera over altar, between Agrippa I 
and Herod of Chalcis, each crowning the emperor with a wreath; [L H (date) in exergue] / [OPKIA BAΣ ME AΓPIΠΠA ΠΡ 
Σ]EΒ KAIΣAP AK Σ[YNKΛHTON K ΔHMO] PO[M ΦI]ΛI K ΣYNMAXI] AYTOY (A vow and treaty of friendship and 
alliance between the Great King Agrippa and Augustus Caesar, the Senate and the People of Rome) in two concentric circles 
divided by wreath; clasped right hands in center; c/m: crude male head left and spear(?) within large oval incuse. Burnett, 
Coinage 8; Hendin 1248; Meshorer 124a; RPC I 4982. VF, dark brown-green patina, traces of undertype. Extremely rare and 
of great historical importance. 
($5000) 

Agrippa I had a close relationship with both Gaius (Caligula) and Claudius, in part helping to secure the rule of the latter in the uncertain 
days following his unexpected rise to the purple. Indeed, his relationship with Claudius was so close that Josephus (Ant. xix. 5.1) records that 
among the new emperor&apos;s first acts was publishing an edict guaranteeing Agrippa&apos;s kingdom (with the title &quot;Great King&quot;) and granting the 
territory of Chalcis to Agrippa&apos;s elder brother Herod. 

This remarkable and extremely rare issue not only explicitly refers to the alliance on the reverse, even using Agrippa&apos;s new title &quot;Great King&quot;, 
but depicts the oath taking ceremony that occurred in the Roman Forum and is discussed in historical sources: 

He also made a league with this Agrippa, confirmed by oaths, in the middle of the Forum in the city of Rome. (Josephus, Ant. xix.5.1) 

He struck his treaties with foreign princes in the Forum, sacrificing a pig and reciting the ancient formula of the fetial priests. (Suetonius, 
Claud. 25.5) 

This issue is typically found in poor condition with much of the legends illegible. The legends given here are taken from Burnett&apos;s study, 
reconstructed from the specimens known to him, although there are slight variants among them. For the extremely rare counterpart issue of 
Herod of Chalcis with a similar obverse, albeit with the position of the brothers switched, see Meshorer 361.

The obverse of this coin honors Poppaea, Nero&apos;s (and previously Otho&apos;s) wife. In January of 63 CE she gave birth to Claudia, who survived 
only four months. This is the only coinage issued in the name of Nero&apos;s daughter. According to Suetonius, Nero killed Poppaea, while pregnant 
with another child, by violently kicking her in the abdomen.

Unpublished Elagabalus Tetradrachm Celebrating the Victory Over Macrinus 

1776. 
MESOPOTAMIA, Carrhae or Edessa. Elagabalus. AD 218-222. AR Tetradrachm (24mm, 12.71 g, 12h). AVT • 
K • M • A • • ANTΩNЄINOC, radiate, draped, and cuirassed bust right / ΔHMAPX • ЄΞ VΠA • TO • B •, eagle standing facing, 
head and tail right, with wings spread, holding wreath in beak; between legs, Nike advancing right, holding palm frond and 
wreath (or globe?); • to left and right of head. Unpublished. Good VF, deeply toned. Unique. 
($1000) 

Under Elagabalus, tetradrachm production became centralized either at the mint of Antioch or Emesa. The exception appears to be in 
Mesopotamia; the frontier province enjoyed a considerable amount of freedom in coin production, striking extremely rare Greek legend 
tetradrachms (Prieur 1724) and Latin legend aurei (Leu 42, lot 373) for the emperor. As Elagabalus claimed to be the illegitimate son of 
Caracalla and his cousin Julia Soaemias, many of these coins stress the continuity of the Severan line by featuring Divus Septimius Severus, 
Divus Caracalla or, most remarkably, Plautilla on the reverse. 

The portrait on the current coin is stylistically close to Prieur 1730 and the unique Leu aureus, and is probably by the same hand responsible for 
some issues struck at or for Carrhae during the reign of Macrinus (see especially Prieur 829 for a similar portrait of Diadumenian). The pellets 
in the reverse field are also characteristic of issues of Carrhae under Macrinus, which Prieur (p. 99) thought to have a religious significance. 
The striking of coinage in Mesopotamia for this period is not so clear cut, however. Other tetradrachms of Elagabalus feature Edessa&apos;s 
characteristic &quot;shrine&quot; mintmark between the eagle&apos;s legs, and the dynastic issues have generally been given to this mint. So the same artists 
may have been engraving dies for different mints, or a single mint may have struck coins for both cities. Whatever the case may be, in this 
instance the Nike between the eagle&apos;s legs should not be interpreted as a mintmark. The current coin was almost certainly produced at the same 
time as the dynastic issues, with Nike symbolizing the victory over Macrinus and the reestablishment of the Severan line.

All of Domitian&apos;s tetradrachms are extremely rare, and this coin is not an exception. RPC cites this coin, ex Empire Coins 8, and Dattari 445 
(= Emmett 238.2). Dattari had a second example photographed in the Savio plates, Dattari 6719, which brings the known examples up to three. 
Another interesting aspect of this coin is that the regnal year (2) is completely spelled out in Greek. 

Unusual Portrait of Hadrian 

1779. 
EGYPT, Alexandria. Hadrian. AD 117-138. AE Drachm (34mm, 21.80 g, 12h). Dated RY 2 (AD 117/8). Laureate

From the Syracuse Collection. 

Hadrian&apos;s portraits on his early coins in Alexandria more closely resemble Trajan, as the engravers in the provinces waited for an official 
Imperial model or bust to be sent out. In this case, by Hadrian&apos;s regnal year 2, the engravers might have had access to or knowledge of what 
Hadrian looked like, as the portrait on the present coin is beginning to morph into a more accurate representation of Hadrian&apos;s Imperial image.

A rarity in the Alexandrian series is any coin with the regnal year of 9, abbreviated with its Greek letter equivalent of Θ. The ancients were as 
superstitious as modern man, and avoided the use of Θ as it was the first letter for Thanatos (Θανατοσ), the Greek personification of &quot;death&quot;. 
Most Alexandrian coins for regnal year 9 used the entire Greek word for nine (ΕΝΑΤΟΥ).

Ex Numismatica Ars Classica 59 (4 April 2011), lot 1151. 

Because of the reverse, this tetradrachm has been erroneously attributed as an issue related to the Festival of Isis coinage. Alfoldi, in his work 
on the subject, demonstrated that all the Festival of Isis coinage was of imperial type, minted at Rome in the later fourth century AD, and 
conformed to a standardized legend and type -VOTA PVBLICA and the goddess standing on her divine ship. Since he listed no provincial 
issues commemorating the festival, and since the striking of provincial coinage had ended by the beginning of the fourth century, it is 
reasonable to conclude that this tetradrachm, while it does depict Isis, is not to be associated with the festival in Rome. 

In any event, this type is very rare, and some extremely rare Alexandrian coins may offer a clue for its use under Diocletian. Egypt was 
undergoing a number of economic changes as the Roman government was beginning to end the production of its provincial coinage and 
replacing it with imperial types. During this transition, while the mint was striking tetradrachms of a more imperial style with increasingly 
imperial types, very rare undated issues, some with specifically Egyptian reverses, such as this coin, were also struck. Most likely, these latter 
coins were an attempt to ease the changes taking place and accommodate a population used to its local monetary types. Ultimately, this policy 
failed to satisfy, for shortly after the new imperial coinage was introduced, a revolt in Egypt broke out under Domitius Domitianus.

ROMAN REPUBLICAN COINAGE 

The Olav E. Klingenberg Collection 

CNG is pleased to present a selection of Roman coins from the collection of Olav E. Klingenberg, 
a retired lawyer from Norway. An active collector, Olav is the editor of the Norwegian Numismatic 
Journal, and a member of the board of the Norwegian Numismatic Society. 

Starting out as an &quot;all-around&quot; collector, he concentrated on ancient coins in recent years, but 
has now decided to narrow his focus to mainly Greek coins. Olav decided to sell his collection of 
Roman coinage, about half of which will be sold through CNG -some of the finer specimens are 
offered in this sale, with the balance of his material appearing in CNG&apos;s Electronic Auction 361, 
which closes on 14 October 2015. 

After retirement, Olav studied history, art history, and related topics at the University of Oslo. 
&quot;Exploring why, and in what context the coin was minted gives an extra dimension to this hobby,&quot; 
he stated. Olav&apos;s diverse interests are reflected by his articles and lectures, which vary from &quot;The 
Carson City Mint&quot; to &quot;Bactria, a Greek kingdom in Afghanistan.&quot;

Sextus Pompey, the younger son of Pompey the Great, inherited his father&apos;s vast influence and personal following. He first established himself 
in Spain in 44 BC as the successful leader of the anti-Caesarian forces and following the death of Caesar, the Senate, believing itself freed from 
the domination of the Caesarians, bestowed on Sextus the title of praefectus classis et orae maritimae (Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet and 
of the Sea Coasts). However, four months later the Senate was forced by Octavian and the second triumvirate to rescind this title, and Sextus 
was proscribed. Upon receiving word of the Senate&apos;s abrogation of his commission and seeing the hostilities the Caesarians were exacting on 
the leading figures in Rome, Sextus set sail from Massilia in Gaul and headed for Sicily. Here he established a powerful base from which he 
could blockade Italy and provide a safe haven for those fleeing the proscriptions. Alarmed at the developments, Octavian sent a naval squadron 
under the command of Salvidienus Rufus to handle the situation, but Salvidienus was defeated off the coast of Rhegium. Following this battle, 
Sextus took the title of imperator iterum. Sextus would continue the republican struggle against the second triumvirate until his death in 36 
BC. This remarkable dynastic aureus provides us with the most life-like portraits of Pompey&apos;s two sons and records many of the events of 43-
42 BC. The oak wreath (corona civica) and the title IMP ITER on the obverse commemorate Sextus&apos; defeat of Salvidienus, while the reverse 
legend records the title bestowed on him by the Senate in 43 BC. The lituus behind Pompey&apos;s head signifies Pompey&apos;s membership in the 
college of augurs, while the tripod behind Cnaeus&apos; head represents his affiliation with the quindecimviri sacris faciundis.

One of the most important coins associated with an event in ancient history, this denarius pointedly commemorates the assassination of Julius 
Caesar by depicting the perpetrator of the act (Brutus), by naming the date of the act (EID[ibus] MAR[tiis], by displaying the instruments of 
the act (daggers) between the reason for the act (the pileus [freedman&apos;s cap] as a symbol of liberty). Though many senators plotted against 
Caesar and are collectively represented by the two daggers, the portrait of Brutus alone emphasizes his primary role in the conspiracy. 

The only securely identified portraits of Brutus occur on coins inscribed with his name; all others, whether on coins or other artifacts, are 
identified based on the three issues inscribed BRVTVS IMP (on aurei) or BRVT IMP (on denarii). A careful study of Brutus&apos; portraits by S. 
Nodelman segregates these inscribed portraits into three main categories: a &apos;baroque&apos; style portrait on the aurei of Casca, a &apos;neoclassical&apos; style 
on the aurei of Costa, and a &apos;realistic&apos; style on the &apos;EID MAR&apos; denarii, which Nodelman describes as &quot;the soberest and most precise&quot; of all.

Serving as scouts and messengers, the cohortes speculatorum filled the role of spies within each legion. Normally ten in number per legion, 
Mark Antony created a special group of cohortes who specifically served around him, carrying out personal instructions and protecting his 
well-being, essentially acting as an early secret service-a concept which was further developed during the empire under Augustus.

Duplicate from the collection of M. A. Armstrong. Ex Classical Numismatic Group 40 (4 December 1996), lot 1383 [&quot;the finest known&quot; -at 
the time]. 

Tiberius Claudius Germanicus was born on 12 February AD 41, only a few weeks after his father, Claudius, became emperor. After Claudius&apos; 
conquest of Britain in AD 43, the boy&apos;s name was changed to Tiberius Claudius Caesar Britannicus, and the sources refer to him simply as 
Britannicus. In AD 55 while dining with friends, he was poisoned and died. The murder was almost certainly ordered by Nero who wanted to 
clear the way for his own succession to the throne. 

The attribution of the sestertii of Britannicus has been a matter of some speculation. Formerly, the issue had been attributed to Rome around the 
end of Claudius&apos; reign when Britannicus adopted the toga virilis. Mattingly, however, demonstrated that such an attribution was problematic, 
since the Rome mint was not producing aes at that time. Instead, he assigned the type to the early years of Titus, when many restoration and 
commemorative issues were being struck, a logical assumption given the reported close friendship between the two. More recently, substantial 
numbers of Latin coins (sestertii and dupondii) in the name of Britannicus, Agrippina Jr., Nero Caesar, and Nero Augustus have been found 
in the Balkan region, and von Kaenel argued for a Thracian origin for the series. Von Kaenel&apos;s analysis is plausible, since the style and fabric 
of the coins, as well as the find spots, indeed suggest a Thracian mint, and such local issues would have been struck for use by the legions 
servicing the border.

This reverse type copies a famed Greek bronze sculpture dating to the 4th century BC, generally thought to be the work of the artist Lysippus. 
It depicts a weary Hercules after completing his Labors: he is shown leaning on his club, draped with the skin of the Nemean Lion and 
set upright on a rock, and he holds the Apples of the Hesperides behind his back in his right hand. Like many other masterpieces of Greek 
art, Lysippus&apos; sculpture was widely copied by the Romans. The most famous copy of this particular work is the marble Farnese Hercules, 
discovered in the excavations of the Baths of Caracalla in 1546. It stood for over 200 years in the Palazzo Farnese in Rome, from whence it 
gained its name, and was moved to Naples in 1787, where it is now displayed in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale.

The widow of Odenathus, the ruler of the rich eastern trade center Palmyra, and the mother and regent of Vabalathus, Septimia Zenobia 
became a powerful regional ruler in her own right. Granted de facto power in the East by the emperor Gallienus to counteract the Persian 
advance, Odenathus used the opportunity to establish his own separatist kingdom. When Odenathus was murdered in AD 267, Zenobia used 
the moment to advance her son Vabalathus. Since he was still in his minority, Zenobia took over as regent, using the confusion following the 
death of Gallienus to offset her position between Rome and Persia and expand Palmyrene power. In AD 269, the Palmyrenes seized control of 
Egypt and with it, the Roman grain supply. To bolster her position, Zenobia began to lay claims to an illustrious ancestry, including Cleopatra 
VII of Egypt and the legendary Dido of Carthage. 

Aurelian, initially taken with concerns in the west, pragmatically acquiesced to Zenobia and Vabalathus&apos; rule in the east. Eventually, though, 
the situation was stabilized in the west, allowing him to vigorously campaign against them in AD 272. Palmyra was sacked, and both Zenobia 
and Vabalathus were captured as they tried to make their way to Persia. She was brought to Rome and paraded in Aurelian&apos;s triumph in AD 
274, bound in gold chains. According to later tradition, Aurelian, impressed by her beauty and dignity, later freed her, and granted her a villa 
in Tibur, where she spent the rest of her life.

This charming reverse depicts Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter in the guise of young boys at play, with each season bearing some

time to time on issues from the 2nd century until the Tetrarchic period. The reverse legend proclaims &quot;the happiness of the times&quot; (temporum 
felicitas), presumably intended as a reference to the improved state of affairs in Britain since Carausius&apos; seizure of power from the corrupt and 
inefficient central government.

The Tres Monetae, female personifications of the metals of gold, silver, and bronze used to strike coins, regularly appear on Imperial medallions 
during the economic crisis of the second half of the third century and reflect the efforts of a series of emperors to revive the economy through 
monetary reform. By the time of the Tetrarchy, massive inflation had crippled the economy and Diocletian implemented dramatic economic 
reforms, which included the introduction of the silver argenteus and bronze follis/nummus in AD294/5.

From an Ornate Necklace 

1980. 
Gold cross pendant. Circa 650-750. (40x54mm, 8.24 g). Hollow-formed cross pendant decorated with a central 
cross framed by a scroll pattern supporting a smaller cross within a circular frame in each arm. A few light cracks, otherwise 
a well preserved and impressive piece. 
($3000) 

From the Joan Wilde Collection, purchased from Tom Cederlind. 

This cross was very likely the central element of a highly ornate necklace. Such a necklace with a similar (but solid cast) pectoral cross was 
uncovered in the 1902 Second Cyprus Treasure (see Kurt Weitzmann, ed. Age of Sprituality: Late antique and early Christian art, third to 
seventh century [Metropolitan Museum of Art: New York, 1979], no. 285). Cross and whorl patterns are fairly rare on gold pectoral crosses 
of the time, with figural designs of Christ, the Virgin, saints or angels more frequently encountered.

This enigmatic issue, which employs a Phocas-style portrait, must have been struck early in Heraclius reign prior to the arrival of the new, 
official imago. It is clearly the product of a subsidiary mint in the East, which also produced some solidi with facing busts of Heraclius and 
a young Heraclius Constantine. The traditional attribution to Jerusalem has been called into question, but a satisfactory alternative has not 
been put forth.

While hybrid dates are quite common in the Carthaginian series, they almost always combine dies of successive years. In this case, the 
engraver must have mistakenly omitted the final Є in the date on the obverse, rather than the mint employing a five year old die.

Artavasdus was an able general who rose to prominence under Leo III and earned the hand of the emperor&apos;s daughter Anna. A year after the 
death of Leo, he usurped the throne from his brother-in-law Constantine V. Artavasdus quickly raised his son Nicephorus to the rank of co-
emperor, and most of the scant surviving coins from his reign feature a portrait of Nicephorus on the reverse. This exceptionally rare coin is 
from the usurper&apos;s first issue, before the elevation of Nicephorus, and features the canonical cross potent on steps reverse. 

Artavasdus was an iconodule whose decision to restore the icons was well received by the populace. The reverse legend on this rare issue, 

IhSЧS XRISτЧS nICA, replacing the usual VICTORIA AVGЧ legend found on previous solidi of this type, achieves a different religious 

tone than had appeared on the gold issues of Leo and Constantine, and may have been chosen to appease a frustrated church and citizenry.

In April 1191, a fleet bearing English forces and the fiancée of Richard the Lion-heart, Berengeria of Navarre, encountered rough seas off 
the coast of Cyprus. The stranded English were treated harshly by the rebel Byzantine prince Isaac Comnenus, ruler of Cyprus, who held a 
reputation for brutality. Richard, following in his own fleet on his way to assist his cousin Guy of Lusignan at Acre, landed at Limassol in 
May and in short order defeated and captured Isaac. Richard only remained on Cyprus for a few weeks before selling the island to the Knights 
Templar and continuing on to the Holy Land. In 1192, the Templars in turn sold Cyprus to Guy, now dispossessed of his fief in Palestine, who 
founded the Lusignan dynasty there. These rare and enigmatic tetartera, with their Byzantine style portrait and cross with the Latin legend 
REX, were probably struck in Cyprus for Richard during his brief stopover on that island. They have been found in equal numbers on Cyprus 
and in Syria-Palestine, indicating that they were struck on Cyprus and then accompanied the English on their continuing crusade.

Louis XII seized control of Milan early in 1499, ousting the ruling Sforzas. In 1508, under the leadership of Pope Julius II, the French joined 
with the Holy Roman Empire and Spain in the League of Cambrai against Venice. The alliance soon fell apart, however, due to the League&apos;s 
inability to follow up their successes and the Pope&apos;s growing distrust of the French. The Holy League was formed in 1510, an alliance of 
the Pope, Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, and England against Louis XII. The stunning French victory under Gaston de Foix at Ravenna in 
1512 was quickly overshadowed by his death during that battle. At the same time, the Swiss invasion of Milan compelled Louis to withdraw 
completely from his Italian interests.

Frederick II Hohenstaufen, &quot;Stupor Mundi&quot; (&quot;Wonder of the World&quot;), was the most enlightened ruler of the medieval European world, and 
single-handedly almost ignited a renaissance a century before it took hold in western Europe. Besides encouraging the study of both the 
ancient and natural worlds (he wrote an insightful treatise on falconry), Frederick was instrumental in improving relations with the Muslims, 
negotiating free access to Christian holy sites in Palestine, where all Crusader armies had been unsuccessful. One of his innovations was a 
gold coinage comparable in style and quality to the gold of the ancient Caesars. The classical motifs proclaimed his inheritance of the legacy 
of Rome, and the augustale and its fractions were issued concurrently with the publication of the Constitution of Melfi, his codification of 
Norman law meant to follow the famous Roman law codes. These coins were struck until Frederick&apos;s death in 1250, and may have been 
continued by his successors for about another fifteen years.

Eadwald would appear to have profited from the succession crisis in the Mercian royal house after the death of Offa in 796. He seized power 
in East Anglia, retaining control for a number of years before Mercian hegemony was reasserted under Coenwulf. He is only known from his 
coins.

Saxon Eyrir Weight 

2259. 
ANGLO-SAXON, Anglo-Viking (Danish East Anglia)(?). Late 9th century. PB Eyrir (Ounce) Weight (20mm, 
21.18 g). Circular lead weight obverse inset with gilt Series D, type 2c sceat. Pit in reverse. Cf. G. Williams, &quot;Anglo-Saxon 
and Viking Coin Weights,&quot; in BNJ 69 (1999), no. 5 (for a similar lead weight with inset Porcupine-type sceat). Much as made. 
Very rare and interesting. 
($1500) 

Reportedly found in Norfolk, 1980s. 

Williams&apos; analysis of the known weights of this type clearly places them in the Danelaw during the later ninth century, when the Viking 
economy was still bullion-based, and weights were used for weighing both coinage and bullion. Based on a value of 24-26.6 g for a Viking 
ounce (eyrir), this particular weight, at 21.18 g, is unusually light, about three grams shy of what is to be expected, though this could likely be 
attributed to a later removal of material from the reverse. 

The purpose of the coins set into these weights remains uncertain, but Williams suggests that they served both a decorative and a practical 
function as a symbol of authority. Although the Viking economy was still pre-monetary, Williams notes that the Vikings were familiar with 
coinage and likely recognized that coin designs represented state authority. He also suggests that the Vikings were probably familiar with 
Anglo-Saxon coin weights, which were validated by the virtue of being stamped with official dies, and argues that the lack of coin dies for use 
on their own weights was remedied by applying a coin within each. Williams points out that the fact that some of the coins used were issued by 
Anglo-Saxon kings would have been irrelevant, as the vast majority of the Vikings were illiterate. The present example supports this idea, as 
the coin inset, a Series D sceat of Frisian origin, should have mostly fallen out of circulation in England by this time. Accordingly, the weight 
could not have been used to validate only a particular series.

($15,000) 

Found near Pocklington, East Riding, Yorkshire, March 2015. 

In 939, following the death of Aethelstan, the Vikings, under Anlaf Guthfrithsson, occupied York. This occupation lasted until Eadred defeated 
them in 954, although the Anglo-Saxons briefly recovered York from 944-7 and 948-9. During this occupation, the Vikings struck a variety of 
coin issues, all quite rare today, with fewer than 200 of all vareities combined. There are three groups of coins that were struck: those following 
the types of the contemporary Anglo-Saxon coinage, types that were copies of special issues by the Anglo-Saxons or earlier Vikings, and types 
that were new, original Norse designs. The last group, comprising the Raven and Triquetra types, are perhaps the most intriguing. 

The exact arrangement of the Viking coinage has been a matter of great debate, and only recently has the picture been relatively clear, with 
the advent of specialized studies that examined the coinage in context with the contemporary Anglo-Saxon issues (esp. CTCE and a variety 
of articles by the late Mark Blackburn). The Raven and Triquetra types appear to have been the two earliest issues from Viking York, with 
the former believed to have only lasted during the reign of Anlaf Guthfrithsson, while the latter belonged to his successor, Anlaf Sithricsson 
(Cuaran). 

M. Blackburn&apos;s descriptions of these coins, in his article in Aspects of Anglo-Scandinavian York, is unsupassable: &quot;[The Raven type] has one 
of the most dramatic coin designs in the English series. It shows the classic Viking symbol, a raven, with head turned left and outstretched 
wings.... The following issue also has Scandinavian motifs: a triquetra, a common element in interlace design and a motif that recurs on 11th-
century Danish and Norwegian coins, and a triangular banner of distinctive Viking form found in Scandinavian metalwork and on some rare 
London coins of Cnut. Yet each of these designs can also be recognized in a Christian context: the raven is associated with St. Oswald (a 
Northumbrian royal saint), the triquetra represents the Trinity in some 7th-8th century art, and the triangular banner on the coins is decorated 
with a cross. ...[W]e can speculate whether the designers were subtly appealing to a dual audience. Did Archbishop Wulfstan&apos;s apparent 
alliance with Olaf Guthfrithsson ensure that the church continued to influence royal policy?&quot;

The Winchester series of the AEthelstan&apos;s Circumscription Cross includes several anomalous issues described by Blunt as irregular, but 
included in Harvey&apos;s die study as official issues. While the engraving on these and the present pieces is crude and several of the letters are 
retrograde, it is quite possible that they are simply rough official issues.

Though described by NGC as a circulation strike, ESC notes: &quot;With some hesitancy these inscribed edge proofs have been included as they 
have been published previously and are generally considered to have been struck. This is confirmed by the other denominations of which 
there are undoubted proofs. The standard of the striking of these crowns was so high and they were issued, and are still found, in such perfect 
preservation that is is almost impossible to distinguish a proof from a perfect ordinary specimen.&quot;

The Fleischbrücke, built in the mid-late 1590&apos;s, has stood as a an architectural wonder for the past four centuries, crossing the river Pegnitz in 
the center of the old city and linking the districts St. Sebald and St. Lorenz along the axis of the main market. A bridge constructed ahead of 
its time, its designers employed several technical features unusual for the late Renaissance, such as its large width of 15.3 m and a clear span 
of 27 m, as well as its minimal rise of only 4.2 m and span-to-rise ratio of 6.4 to 1 -making it second only to the Ponte Santa Trinita, built 30 
years earlier in Firenze, in terms of its nearly flat profile. 

The only change to the bridge after its construction came in the form of a portal added in 1599 bearing the inscription Omnia habent ortus 
suaque in crementa sed ecce quem cernis nunquam bos fuit hic Vitulus: &quot;All things have a beginning and grow, but look: Never has been the ox 
you see a calf.&quot; Possibly in reference to this inscription, the medal depicts on ox resting upon the pediment of one of the undamaged buildings 
in the background, reinforcing both the steadfastness and the seemingly eternal presence of the bridge.
