AUCTION TERMS 

All written, fax, email and phone bids must be received by 5PM (ET) October 6, 2015. 

The Electronic Close starts at 9AM ET on October 7, 2015. Lots close every 15 seconds. 

To participate in this sale electronically you must be registered and approved to bid on www.cngcoins.com. 

Please read the auction terms for new information regarding bidding, buyer&apos;s fees, and payment of invoices. 

This is an internet and mail bid sale with an automated electronic close, con-
ducted by Classical Numismatic Group, Inc. (CNG). Bidding in the auction 
constitutes acceptance of the following terms: 

1. The property listed in this catalogue is offered for sale by CNG for itself 
and as agent for various owners and other consignors. We reserve the right 
to reject any bid, to determine the opening price, to set bidding increments, 
to vary the order of the auction, to reopen bidding in the case of a dispute, to 
withdraw any lot, to bid on behalf of CNG, to bid on behalf of the consignor, 
and to permit the consignor to bid on his own lots. CNG may loan or advance 
money to consignors or prospective bidders, and may have an interest other 
than commission charges in any lot. CNG may bid on its own account as an 
&quot;insider&quot; with information not available to the public. 

2. Lots will be sold in the order listed in the catalogue. The first lot will 
close electronically at www.cngcoins.com at 9AM Eastern Time on the sale 
date, with subsequent lots closing every 15 seconds thereafter. All written, 
fax, email and phone bids must be received by 5PM Eastern Time, on the day 
prior to the sale date. Electronic bids may be placed by approved bidders up 
until the closing time of each lot. The electronic clock on the website represents 
the official closing time for each lot. Bidders intending to bid electronically 
must first register at www.cngcoins.com. New website registrations are pro-
cessed for approval Monday through Friday 9AM-5PM Eastern Time only. No 
new registrations will be approved on the sale date. 

3. A 20% Buyer&apos;s Fee will be added to the hammer price of all success-
ful written, fax, email and phone bids. A 17.5% Buyer&apos;s Fee will be added 
to the hammer price of all successful electronic bids directly placed on www. 
cngcoins.com. 

4. All coins are guaranteed genuine. Attribution, date, condition and other 
descriptions are the opinion of the cataloguer, and no warranty is expressed 
or implied. Please note that an auction sale is not an approval sale. Lots 
examined prior to the sale and lots purchased by floor bidders (including bid-
ders executing commission bids on behalf of other parties) may not be returned 
for any reason except lack of authenticity. All claims of misdescription and all 
claims of return, except claims regarding authenticity, must be made within 5 
days of receipt of material. Any claim of lack of authenticity must be made 
in writing by the original purchaser immediately after discovery that an item 
is not authentic, and upon making such a claim the original purchaser must 
immediately return the lot to CNG in the same condition as at the time of the 
auction. Coins that have been encapsulated (&quot;slabbed&quot;) by a grading and/or 
authentication service may not be returned for any reason, including authen-
ticity, if they have been removed from the encapsulation (&quot;slab&quot;). If payment 
is made by credit card, rights of return are governed by these Auction Terms 
which supercede any rights of return promulgated by the card issuer. Estimates 
are intended as a guide only and not as a statement of opinion of value. 

5. Invoices are due and payable immediately upon receipt. Interest and late 
fees of 2.0% per month, or at the highest rate permitted by law, whichever 
is less, from the date of the auction, shall be payable on invoices not settled 
within 30 days of the auction date. Payment may be made by check or bank 
wire. Credit cards (Visa or MasterCard) will be accepted; credit card payments 
will not be accepted more than 14 days after the sale date. Payment by check 
must be made in either US dollars ($) drawn on a US bank or British sterling 
(£) drawn on a British bank. All successful bidders outside North America and 
the United Kingdom will be charged an additional $20 fee for bank charges 
that are the result of international wire transfer fees; this fee will be deducted 
for credit card or check payment as described above. CNG may reduce or 
compromise any charge or fee at its discretion. 

6. Bidders not known to us must provide satisfactory credit references or 
pay a deposit as determined at CNG&apos;s discretion before bidding. Minors are 
not permitted to bid without written consent of a parent guaranteeing payment. 
CNG may require payment in full from any bidder prior to delivery of lots. 
Title does not pass until lots are paid in full. Upon receipt of lots, the buyer 
assumes full responsibility for loss or damage. Delivery to the buyer&apos;s address 
of record shall constitute receipt by the buyer regardless of the identity of the 
person accepting delivery. 

7. Estimates are in U.S. dollars ($) and bids must be made in even dollar 
($) amounts. The CNG website, www.cngcoins.com, will execute electronic 
bids on behalf of all electronic bidders. Subject to reserves and opening prices, 
all electronic bids will be executed by the electronic software at one bidding 
increment (approximately 10%) over the next highest bid. All written, fax, 
email and phone bids received before 5PM the day prior to the sale date will be 
uploaded to the CNG website no later than the day prior to the sale date. These 
bids will not be subject to the minimum required bid cited on the website at 
the time of the upload. Any written, fax, email and phone bids received after 
the deadline or with special instructions will be executed at CNG&apos;s complete 
discretion and will be subject to the next bid required by the website. In the 
case of identical written, fax, email and phone bids, the earliest bid received 
wins. An electronic bid has priority over any identical written, fax, email or 
phone bid. Bid by lot number. No lot will be broken. Bidders are responsible 
for errors in bidding. Check your bids carefully. Electronic bidders may check 
their bids under User Services at www.cngcoins.com. 

8. A word on Reserves. CNG may place a reserve on any lot. However, no 
reserve will be higher than the estimate, and ordinarily lots are reserved at 60% 
of estimate. 

9. Bidders personally guarantee payment for their successful bids, including 
bidders executing commission bids from other parties and bidders representing 
corporations or other entities. Buyers accepting commission bids from other 
parties do so at their own risk and remain responsible for payment under these 
Auction Terms. 

10. In the event a successful bidder fails to make full payment within 30 
days of the auction date, CNG reserves the right to deem the sale incomplete 
and to resell the material, and the bidder agrees to pay for the reasonable cost 
of such a sale and also to pay any difference between the resale price and the 
previously successful bid. CNG reserves all rights that it is entitled to under 
the Pennsylvania Uniform Commercial Code, including the right to offset any 
sums due from a successful bidder against any future consignment or purchase 
or monies or goods in possession of CNG. 

11. Sales tax, postage, handling and insurance are the responsibility of the 
buyer and are added to all invoices where appropriate. For buyers in the 
European Union, CNG may import lots into the United Kingdom prior to 
shipment and charge buyers the import Value Added Tax. On any tax not paid 
by the purchaser which should have been paid, even if not invoiced by CNG, 
the purchaser agrees to pay the same on demand together with any interest or 
penalty that may be assessed. It is the responsibility of the buyer to comply 
with foreign customs and other regulations. 

12. Prices realized are published and are mailed with CNG&apos;s next publica-
tion. Prices realized are posted at www.cngcoins.com and successful electronic 
bidders are notified by email after the last lot of the sale closes. 

13. Bidders hereby waive any claim for incidental, consequential or exem-
plary damages arising from this auction. The sole remedy that any participant 
in the auction shall have for any claim or controversy arising out of the auction 
shall be a refund, without interest, of all or part of the purchase price paid by 
the participant. 

14. All rights granted by CNG or otherwise available to bidders and pur-
chasers, under these Auction Terms or otherwise, are personal and may not 
be assigned or transferred to any other person or entity, whether by operation 
of law or otherwise. No third party may rely on any benefit or right conferred 
by these Auction Terms. Bidders acting as agents must disclose the agency in 
writing to CNG prior to the auction; otherwise rights are limited to the agent 
and are not transferable to the undisclosed principal. 

15. Any dispute regarding this auction shall be governed by the laws of 
Pennsylvania and shall be adjudicated only by the Lancaster County Court 
of Common Pleas or the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of 
Pennsylvania; all bidders submit themselves to the personal jurisdiction of 
these courts for this purpose, consent to service of process by registered or 
certified mail, and waive any contrary provisions of Articles 14 or 15 of the 
French Civil Code and any similar provisions in any jurisdiction. All bidders 
consent to the confidentiality of consignors&apos; identities and waive any right to 
require disclosure of the name of the consignor or owner of any auction lot, 
whether such right is based on New York GOL  §5-701(a) or any other provi-
sion in any jurisdiction. In any dispute regarding this auction, the prevailing 
party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorney fees. </preface>

The Dr. Lawrence A. Adams Collection 

Dr. Lawrence (Larry) Alexander Adams was born on May 
31, 1935 in Los Angeles, California, the son of Alexander 
and Lucille (née Spiker) Adams. His father was a salesman 
in the Wholesale Market and Restaurant business. Dr. 
Adams died unexpectedly on March 24, 2015, just a couple 
of months short of what would have been his 80th birthday. 
Larry is survived by Meredith (née Nieboer) Adams, his 
wife of 54 years. A prominent Dermatologist specializing in 
Dermatologic Surgery (Mohs-Micrographic Surgery), Larry 
worked his entire professional career for Kaiser Permanente 
in the Greater Los Angeles area. 

Larry received both his undergraduate degree and then his 
medical education at Loyola University of Chicago, the 
Stritch School of Medicine, graduating with his M.D. in 1960. 
He did his internship through the Veterans Administration 
Los Angeles Healthcare System in 1960-1; his residency in General Surgery at the University 
of Missouri-Columbia in 1961-2; and his residency in Dermatology at the McGaw Medical 
School of Northwestern University from 1964-7. Larry practiced medicine in California from 
1965 right up until his death in March of 2015, primarily at the Southern California Permanente 
Medical Group, Panorama City Medical Center. 

Besides medicine and his family, Larry&apos;s third passion in life was numismatics, which he began 
pursuing in the 1960s. A friend of Larry&apos;s, Don Corrigan (the son of famous aviator Douglas 
&quot;Wrong-way&quot; Corrigan), advised Larry to purchase only gold coins, and Larry followed this 
advice throughout his collecting career. He purchased gold coinage from ancient to modern, 
with an emphasis on the Middle East, the Early Middle Ages, and the Ptolemies of Egypt. He 
had specialized collections of Kushan, Kushano-Sasanian, Indian (an extensive collection), 
and Bosporan gold coinage. He liked Dutch gold coinage, as his wife is of Dutch ancestry, and 
he collected French gold pattern coinage. Over the last few years, he had started to collect gold 
medals, particularly those from Latin America. In short, if it was gold, and numismatically 
related, Larry probably collected it! He had a &quot;good eye&quot; for coins, and rarity was more 
important to Larry than quality, the mark of a &quot;true&quot; collector and numismatist. 

Larry belonged to many numismatic clubs and organizations, both locally and nationally, but he 
was especially proud of his membership in the &quot;Sunday Morning Get Together&quot;, a numismatic 
breakfast group founded by Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Lissner, Irving &quot;Irv&quot; Goodman, and M. Louis 
&quot;Mark&quot; Teller. Larry joined the group within the first year of its formation. Composed of 
serious, committed numismatists, this &quot;club&quot; grew to become a &quot;who&apos;s who&quot; of prominent 
collectors in the greater Los Angeles area. Members included Dr. Osmund Chan, Dr. Robert 
Hesselgesser, Dr. Vladimir Golovchinsky and Paul Covey from San Antonio, Texas. Victor 
England would sometimes join the group when travelling through the area, and wives, children, 
and grandchildren were always welcomed as guests. 

Another organization that Larry was quite active in was the Society of Ancient Numismatics 
(or SAN). Larry contributed several articles to the SAN Journal, and eventually became the 


7 

publisher of the Journal in 1995. Larry, along with the assistance of David Vagi and Victor 
England, continued to publish the SAN Journal until 2002. 

Larry was also active in the American Numismatic Society (ANS), which he joined in 1982. 
He became a Fellow of the ANS in 1997, and a Trustee in 2001. He served on the Finance 
and Collections committees, and was a member of the Augustus B. Sage Society, an exclusive 
group for the most serious, dedicated members of the ANS. 

Professionally, Larry was the West Coast Representative for the Classical Numismatic Group 
from 1995 until his death. Larry was a fixture at the CNG bourse table at the New York 
International Numismatic Convention, the Chicago International Coin Fair, and the annual 
summer convention of the American Numismatic Association. He represented CNG at most of 
the numismatic bourses in the San Francisco area. If CNG did not have a table at a numismatic 
convention, Larry was often behind the table of Mark Teller and Company. 

Larry purchased coins from most of the leading dealers throughout his numismatic career, 
but relied primarily on CNG (Victor England and Eric McFadden), Mark Teller, and Stephen 
Album for the majority of his purchases. Larry loved to talk coins, and interacted at shows 
and club meetings with collectors and dealers that shared his passion. If a dealer (or collector) 
was visiting the Los Angeles area, Larry and Meredith would often meet them for dinner and 
numismatic conversation. 

The collection of Dr. Lawrence A. Adams will be sold by Classical Numismatic Group in a 
series of sales: several of the firm&apos;s electronic online auctions; CNG 100, an Internet and Mail 
Bid Sale scheduled for 7 October 2015; and Triton XIX, to be sold in conjunction with the 
44th Annual New York International Numismatic Convention on Tuesday and Wednesday, 
5-6 January 2016. Some of Larry&apos;s favorite numismatic auction catalogs were the sales of the 
Virgil M. Brand Collection, sold by Sotheby&apos;s in Zurich, Switzerland in ten parts from July 
of 1982 to October of 1985. As a tribute to Larry and the significance of his collection, CNG 
is following in the tradition of the Brand sales and presenting the Dr. Lawrence A. Adams 
Collection in four separate catalogs using the Brand catalog format.

($2000) 

Ex Classical Numismatic Auctions X (21 March 1990), lot 426. 

This coinage, previously attributed to Capua in Campania, has been conclusively reattributed to the Carthaginians in Bruttium under Hannibal 
(see M.H. Crawford, &quot;Provenances, Attributions, and Chronology of Some Early Italian Coinages,&quot; CH IX [2002], p. 274, and HN Italy). 
While it is likely that this issue was minted in Bruttium by the Carthaginians, there is a possibility that these coins were struck in Carthage and 
transported to South Italy for Hannibal&apos;s use (see G.K. Jenkins, &quot;Some coins of Hannibal&apos;s time,&quot; Studi per Laura Breglia, Parte I, Generalia-

The Coinage of Carthage 

By the third century BC, the Punic goddess Tanit and the horse had become the standard types of Carthaginian coinage and remained so for 
the balance of the city&apos;s existence. Tanit was the primary deity of Carthage. A celestial divinity with some fertility aspects, she was the North 
African equivalent of Astarte. She is always depicted on the coinage wearing a wreath of grain, which may have been borrowed from Demeter 
and Persephone as the Carthaginians assimilated the Sicilian culture into their own during the various Punic excursions to the island. The 
use of the horse on the reverse is usually considered part of the foundation myth of Carthage. According to Virgil&apos;s Aeneid, the Phoenician 
colonists who founded Carthage were told by Juno (or Tanit) to establish the new colony at the place where they discovered a horse&apos;s head in 
the ground. Another theory is that the obverse head is actually Demeter or Persephone, whose worship was introduced to Carthage in 396 BC 
to make amends for the destruction of the goddesses&apos; temples outside Syracuse by the Carthaginian army. 

Carthage began issuing a gold coinage in the 4th century BC, apparently to finance the expansion of their trading empire into Sicily. The 
quality of the gold dropped over time, and by the late 4th century, the series was entirely of electrum. As most of the Carthaginian silver was 
struck at local mints in their occupied cities in Sicily, very little silver was issued at Carthage. However, a robust bronze coinage of multiple 
denominations was issued alongside the gold and electrum coinage, reflecting the flourishing local economy. The conflicts with the Greeks in 
Sicily continued into the 3rd century BC, at which time Carthage also became embroiled in conflict with the new power in the region, Rome. 
This conflict led to three major wars, which continued to put great pressure on the Carthaginian economy, and the degradation in the metal 
quality during the earlier wars continued into this period, with the golden-yellow of the electrum eventually turning into a near white-yellow. 
Silver denominations were also issued more often during this latter period, but also were degraded into a billon coinage. Ultimately, these 
issues came to an end with the destruction of Carthage at the hands of the Romans at the conclusion of the Third Punic War in 146 BC.

Purchased from Classical Numismatic Group, January 2003. 

By the time of the Third Punic War, Carthage had limited precious metal resources at its disposal. H.R. Baldus (&quot;Ein 146 v. Chr. verbrannter 
Geldbörseninhalt aus Karthago,&quot; Chiron 33 [2003], pp. 195-201) has argued that this serrate gold issue was struck from the melted jewelry 
contributed by the women of Carthage during the summer of 149 BC after the Roman siege of the city had begun, an event noted by Diordoros 
(32.9). 

Previously, only 2/5 shekels were known for this issue. Jenkins &amp; Lewis thought these fractions equated to 4/5 shekels (p. 54), but later Jenkins 
(cf. SNG Copenhagen 401-2) and Baldus (in Chiron 33 --see following lot) determined that they were, in fact, 2/5 shekels. The present coin 
is the first full shekel known for this issue.

The letters in the left field of the reverse typically represent the name of a magistrate on the tetradrachms of this type, but Topalov notes that 
there are examples of bronze issues where the name of Apollonia is abbreviated with A-ΠO, with the ΠO separated from the initial A. Thus, 
the ΠO here may not be a magistrate, but the continuation of the city ethnic.

The attribution of this type to northern Greece is based on the similarity of the incuse to that on a variety of staters that were found in a hoard 
in Thrace (see M.J. Price, &quot;A Field in Western Thrace&quot; in CH II). The NFA catalogs, noting the provenance of their pieces and the presence of 
a lioness on early issues of Akanthos, attributed this issue to that city, but there is little evidence to substantiate an electrum issue from there 
(see note to Leu 52). Nevertheless, the type is exceptional, particularly for its portrayal of the lioness as lactating. Perhaps this unusual feature 
is the key to attributing this issue with more certainty?

Purchased from Classical Numismatic Group, July 2005. 

This issue was originally given to Sidon by Newell, along with seven other issues of staters (and two distaters) that lacked the mint signature 
and/or date that is found on nearly all other issues at Sidon. Newell later doubted the attribution, and suggested they may belong to an early 
mint at Damaskos (cf. G.F. Hill, &quot;Alexander the Great and the Persian lion-gryphon,&quot; JHS 43 [1923], p. 159). While Price retained Newell&apos;s 
original attribution, he, too, remained skeptical (Price, p. 436). Le Rider, in his recent review of the coinage of Alexander the Great (Alexander 
the Great: Coinage, Finances, and Policy [Philadelphia, 2007]), recounted the various arguments, but also assimilated more recent research, 
and convincingly argues that these eight issues of gold actually were the first issues of Alexander type staters at the mint of Tarsos (Le Rider, 
op. cit., pp. 134-9). 

The reattribution to Tarsos has a significant effect on the importance of these staters. It is generally thought that Alexander began issuing his 
new coinage, staters of Athena/Nike type and tetradrachms of Herakles/Zeus type, shortly after his capture of Tarsos in 333 BC. Recognizing 
the importance of this mint for Alexander, supported by the state of the evidence at the time, Newell originally attributed a large series of 
staters to the early period of Alexanders at Tarsos (E.T. Newell, &quot;Tarsos under Alexander,&quot; AJN 52 [1918]). Later research, however, moved 
nearly all of these issues to a mint in Macedon (cf. Price p. 371, and Troxell, Studies, pp. 99-110). This void of gold coinage is therefore filled 
with the reattribution of the eight issues from Sidon, resulting in these being not only the first issue of Alexander staters from Tarsos, but the 
first issues of Alexander&apos;s new stater coinage anywhere.

there are apparently four varieties: (1) AΛEΞAN above the bow, ΔPOY below the club; (2) AΛEΞA between the bow and club, NΔPOY

Demetrios&apos; gold coinage consists entirely of Attic-weight staters, issued at first in the name of Alexander, but after circa 299 in his own 
name. Demetrios&apos; proclamation as king of Macedon gave him control of the mints in Amphipolis and Pella, and he inherited the vast bullion 
supplies of Macedon. In order to finance further conquests, he began to turn these supplies into currency. This coin was struck in the last year 
of Demetrios&apos; reign, probably to finance his planned Aitolian campaign. The obverse shows the portrait of Demetrios adorned with the horns 
of a bull, the sacred animal of Poseidon. The reverse pays tribute to a traditional Macedonian type that had been used on the silver coinages 
from Alexander I to Philip II.

In 276 BC, Antigonos hired around 7500 Gauls, under the chieftain Biderius, to help in his campaign against Kassander&apos;s nephew, Antipater 
Etesias. According to Polyaenus, these mercenaries cost Antigonos thirty talents. Mathisen suggests that Antigonos struck his Alexander type 
staters, in Alexander&apos;s name and a small issue in his own name, in order to pay this expenditure. In her dissertation on the coinage of Antigonos 
Gonatas, E. Panagopoulou rejects this theory, noting the unusual replacement of the canonical wreath in Nike&apos;s hand with an aphlaston. This, 
combined with the use of a wreath as subsidiary symbol, suggests to her that the coins are related to a naval victory; most likely Gonatas&apos; 
defeat of the Ptolemaic fleet off Kos (sometime between 262-1 and 255 BC) or the one off Andros (in 246/5 BC). This coin is one of the few 
surviving examples of this coinage; both Mathison and Panagopoulou could locate only five specimens, all of which are now in museum 
collections (London [BM], Paris [BN, 2 specimens], Glasgow [Hunterian], and Vienna [KHM]). More recently, this coin and the Prospero 
piece appeared on the market; they are the first to come to light in over a century.

While the Macedonian Kingdom flourished, it was by no means master of the whole of Greece. In Aitolia a group of tribes developed into 
a powerful league that triumphantly defended the land from the Gallic invasions, which at one point had reached Delphi. The repulsion 
of the Gallic invaders in 279/8 BC was commemorated by a monument erected in the temple of Apollo at Delphi which represented the 
personification of Aitolia. The coins accurately display this monument (see Reinach, supra). A redoubtable female warrior, Aitolos is depicted 
holding a sheathed sword and seated in a defiant posture upon a heap of shields left behind by the enemy. Some of the shields look Macedonian, 
others Gallic. On the silver coins, a Gallic karnyx lies at her feet.

The Tauric Chersonesos, located on the western coast of the Crimea, was founded circa 422 BC by colonists from Herakleia Pontika and 
Delion in Boeotia. The city quickly rose in stature through its wine production, but also through its location, which was better situated for 
trade compared to the other cities in the Cimmerian Bosporos. In turn, as the city grew, Chersonesos established a colony at Karkinitis on 
the northwest coast of the Crimea. In the second century BC, Chersonesos became a target of Skythian raids, and it was forced to appeal to 
Mithridates VI of Pontus for protection. The Pontic king saved the city from the Skythians, but now incorporated Chersonesos into his own 
dominion. With the passing of Mithridates, the city became a part of the Kingdom of Bosporos, but finally regained its independence by 
declaration of the Romans in 36 BC. 

Chersonesos began issuing coinage in the mid 4th century BC, and had a robust production that reflected the successful commercial center 
that it was. Its types are unusually diverse, depicting various gods and mythological creatures, but none of them seem to have been given 
particular significance over any other. Initially, the coinage was almost strictly bronze, with only a couple rare issues of silver. By the third 
century, however, a regular silver coinage began to be produced, comparable in size to that of the bronze. This coinage continued into the 
Roman period, though at a lower level of production after the 1st century BC. In the late 1st century AD, the city issued an unprecedented 
gold coinage. Even today, we cannot fully comprehend the purpose for this remarkable coinage. All of the coins feature the same types: a 
diademed and draped bust on the obverse (sometimes with the city ethnic), and the figure of Artemis on the reverse. These coins are also dated, 
probably a convention copied from the contemporary royal Bosporan coinage. Today, only a handful of these gold coins exist, with most of 
them in public collections.

Although lacking a legend, this series has been attributed to Pergamon, based on similar silver fractions, which also contain the city ethnic, 
ΠEPΓA(M) (SNG France 1558-66). On the other hand, the date of this issue is less certain. SNG France placed it circa 310-284 BC, though 
ignoring that two examples of this type were found in the Saïda hoard (IGCH 1508 = CH VIII 190), which Westermark dated to circa 
323/20 BC. She also saw a correlation between these staters and those of Philippi in Macedon (an example of which was in the hoard), and 
accordingly dated them to after 336 BC (echoed by G.K. Jenkins and M. Castro Hipólito in the Gulbenkian catalog), based on Mørkholm&apos;s 
placement of the Philippi issues during the reign of Alexander (EHC pp. 84-5). Mørkholm&apos;s dating, however, was based on the single coin 
of Philippi in the Saïda hoard (Saïda 34), which was of such high grade that he thought it must have been struck near the date of the hoard&apos;s 
deposit. Other numismatists, however, have placed these Philippi staters earlier, circa 356-345 BC (Bellinger, Philippi p. 37, and N. Waggoner 
in SNG ANS). The hoard also contained ten of the twelve known examples of an extremely rare gold issue of Kios. Significantly, this issue of 
Kios and the fact that the Pergamene staters have a close stylistic affinity with the coinages of Philip II and Alexander III -offer a potential 
clue toward identifying when and why they were struck. 

More recently, F. de Callataÿ has revisited the issue by examining the examples of this issue that have appeared on the market over the last 
decade (F. de Callataÿ. &quot;Les statères de Pergame et les réquisitions d&apos;Alexandre le Grand: l&apos;apport d&apos;un nouveau trésor (&apos;Statères de Pergame 
2004&apos;)&quot; in RN 169 [2012]). Exhibiting no traces of circulation wear, these coins are closer to the full Attic weight than the two more worn 
specimens in the Saïda hoard, suggesting an earlier date for this issue than circa 323/20 BC. Callataÿ also demonstrated (along with the two 
specimens in the Saïda hoard) that in total five obverse and seven reverse dies by two engravers were used in striking this issue, all of which 
are die-linked. The obverse dies share a close stylistic similarity to early Alexandrine issues of Miletos (cf. Leu 81, lot 182) and Abydos (cf. 
CNG 70, lot 92), as well as earlier staters of Philippi (cf. Triton IX, lot 724). Likewise, the control marks that appear on these Pergamene coins 
(Corinthian helmet, rose, and eagle [or cock]), are symbols typically found on coins from early in the reign of Alexander III. The apparently 
brief but intense minting of these Pergamene staters, with their links to Macedonian types struck early in the reign of Alexander III, suggests 
that these coins were struck from funds requisitioned locally for the Macedonian troops in Asia Minor of Alexander himself in 334 BC (cf. 
Diod. Sic. 17.19-21; cf. Plut. Vit. Alex. 16.1-8; cf. Arr. Anab. 1.14-16).

The early coinage of Ephesos was most recently studied by S. Karwiese (Die Münzprägung von Ephesos [Vienna, 1995]), though his 
conclusions have been slightly modified by K. Konuk (see, e.g., SNG Kayhan). This interesting hemistater issue represents a series unknown 
to Karwiese. The first coinage attributable to Ephesos is the electrum series struck under the enigmatic Phanes, circa 625-600 BC, comprising 
a host of denominations from stater to 1/96 stater. Phanes&apos; series was followed by electrum and silver coins that were the first to depict the 
Ephesian bee, circa 600-550 BC (Karwiese Series II.2). The bee on these electrum coins has a very primitive appearance, and the punches on 
the reverse closely resemble those used for the Phanes coinage. The subsequent group, Karwiese&apos;s Series III, circa 550-500 BC, again with 
both electrum and silver issues, featured a more realistic bee on the obverse and a simple rough square incuse on the reverse. The present 
hemistater has a bee that is consistent with the form found on Series III, while the punches on the reverse are distinctly different from those 
of the preceding Series II.2. As such, this issue appears to belong after the earlier bee electrum, while the form of the punches and the fabric 
of the coin suggest that it is earlier than those of Series III. 

It is also possible that this type is not from Ephesos, but from another mint in Asia Minor, considering the unusual incuse form (cf. Rosen 248-
9). This incuse form is also common on early electrum issues from Samos (cf. Wiedauer 196), as well as archaic silver staters from mints in the 
vicinity of Caria (cf. SNG von Aulock 2337 and 2744, and Asyut 694-702). One aspect of the present issue, though, is significantly different 
from all of these non-Ephesian coins: the reverse is composed of two punches from a single rectangular die. Moreover, this peculiarity is 
mimicked on a silver issue, also featuring a similarly-styled bee on the obverse, that came to light recently: CNG 75, lot 360 and CNG 96, lot 
429. This connection provides the strongest evidence for the placement of these coins at Ephesos, as the details of the bee on the CNG 75 coin 
are identical to those on the sole electrum hekte of Karwiese&apos;s Series III. Thus, this issue of electrum hemistaters and silver drachms appear 
to form a new issue at Ephesos, circa 550 BC.

Purchased from Harlan J. Berk, December 1996. 

The Hellenistic staters of Ephesos are all very rare. Originally, they were thought to belong to the period of the Mithradatic Wars, but G.K. 
Jenkins&apos;s 1987 article convincingly argued that they were actually struck over a relatively long period, from the late 2nd to early 1st centuries 
BC. Noting the existence of a stater bearing the name of the Roman official C. Atinius C.f. Labeo (c. 122/1 BC), as well as two issues with 
letters that he equated to the dates on the cistophoric tetradrachms, Jenkins surmised that the entire series of staters was struck in concert with 
the cistophoroi, and may have even continued into the mid-late 1st century BC. Later numismatists, including F. de Callataÿ, have accepted 
his conclusions, particularly noting that the subsidiary symbols on the reverse, while often used by Mithradates, were actually symbols that 
were common to the cult of Artemis in general. While Jenkins&apos; overall conclusions are quite sound, there is one oversight in his analysis. 
While discussing the two dated staters, he notes that the subsidiary symbols on these two coins did not equate to the subsidiary symbols on the 
similary-dated cistophoric tetradrachms. Although he noted that this was not a problem for equating these staters to the tetradrachms, Jenkins 
then uses the subsidiary symbols on the undated staters to equate them to other tetradrachms, and thereby dates these staters based on this 
equivalence. Thus, his dating of the later staters is questionable. 

In addition to the varying symbols on the staters, the ethnic also appears in two different forms. One group has a shortened ethnic, EΦ, across 
the upper field, while a second group has the full ethnic (there is also a single example without any ethnic, but it is not germane to the present 
discussion). Jenkins treated the second group as being separate from the first, and was less certain of its placement, suggesting that it may 
even belong to an earlier period in the mid 3rd-early 2nd centuries. The present coin was not known at the time of Jenkins&apos; article, but adds a 
critical element to the evidence. Previously, all of the long-ethnic coins used a four-bar sigma and the ending -ΩN, but the present coin uses 
a lunate sigma and ends -ωN. The lunate sigma does not appear in any ethnic of Ephesos on coins until the time of Domitian, but this stater 
certainly cannot be of such a late date. Perhaps even more importantly, the -ωN ending does not appear in the ethnic on any other recorded 
coin of Ephesos from the Greek or Roman periods. 

Looking beyond the ethnic, lunate sigmas do appear in magistrates&apos; names at Ephesos as early as the issues of Attic weight drachms and their 
contemporary bronze, albeit rarely. Also, P. Kinns records a single example of one of the bronze issues where the magistrate is spelled with an 
uncial omega (Kinns, Attic, p. 96 = Münzzentrum 51, lot 136). Unfortunately, the letter is not clear at all on that coin; it might be an omicron or 
even a traditional omega. Moreover, the same magistrate&apos;s name appears on the apparent half-unit of the same issue spelled with a traditional 
omega (Kinns, Attic, p. 97 = CNR XVII.4, no. 127). If the uncial omega is correctly read on these coins, though, it would give credence to 
Jenkins&apos;s earlier placement of the full-length ethnic staters and provide a terminus post quem of circa 200 BC for the present coin. This leaves 
one aspect of the present stater in question. 

Jenkins dismissed outright the possibility that the staters had any relation to the Mithradatic period, arguing that the subsidiary symbols 
were more likely reflective of the Ephesian cult of Artemis than the Pontic kingdom. His argument is persuasive concerning the stag and 
bee, both of which are common on coins of Ephesos from the 4th century onward, as well as a few of the other symbols that are also found 
on cistophoric tetradrachms and that are not typical Pontic symbols. However, his argument is less persuasive concerning the star, which is 
a typical Pontic symbol and only appears on a single issue at Ephesos, though it is a cistophoric tetradrachm. The present coin, though, has 
a star-in-crescent, which is a ubiquitous Pontic symbol, used extensively on Pontic royal issues as well as on civic coins of cities under the 
authority of Mithradates VI. It is a symbol that was never used at Ephesos on any other issue. So, it is certainly possible that this coin, unique 
among all the staters, has a direct reference to the Mithradatic period at Ephesos, and Jenkins&apos;s chronology of the series does encompass the 
years that Eupator &quot;freed&quot; the Province of Asia from Rome.

This coin was used in the Basel catalog as an example of the earliest electrum coinage. There, it was attributed as possibly being from Samos, 
while in the sale of that collection by NAC, it was cataloged as an uncertain Ionian issue. Mildenberg considered it an early issue from an 
uncertain mint in Ionia or Lydia. The coin&apos;s obverse form and incuse are vaguely similar to the definitively attributed early electrum of Samos 
(cf. Konuk, Electrum), but this stylistic similarity is insufficient, and this coin is not struck on the Euboic-Samian standard, where a stater 
weighs c. 17.40 grams. Linzalone likewise gives his example to Ionia, but also notes (without citation) that there is some precedent for an 
early Samian issue at a lower weight standard. In any event, it is quite unlikely that this coin is from Samos, and even an Ionian origin is not 
without question, as the findspot of both examples is unknown. Moreover, the weight standard of these two coins comports with the electrum 
staters that are attributed to the Thraco-Macedonian region. Rosen 252 may represent a hemistater of this type.

The Kingdom of Lydia, under the Mermnad dynasty, may well have been the originator of Western coinage. Other than Herodotos&apos; attestation 
that the first gold and silver coins were struck by the kings of Lydia (Herodotos 1.94), there is no ancient literary evidence for the origin 
of coinage. The evidence regarding electrum coins -the earliest -is primarily based on analysis of the coin deposits at the Artemision of 
Ephesos, as well as other archaeological sites and hoards. This evidence strongly suggests that coinage originated in western Asia Minor in 
the mid seventh century BC. The dating of this event has recently been revised upward, as a re-analysis of the Artemision has shown that the 
electrum coins found there were deposited prior to circa 640-620 BC, when the second temple was built on the site. 

Traditionally, electrum was thought to have been a naturally occurring alloy in the rivers and streams of Lydia; an idea that can be traced to 
the 19th century, which was subsequently popularized by Head in his magisterial work, Historia Nummorum. Recent research, however, has 
conclusively shown not only that this idea is incorrect, but also that there were virtually no natural electrum deposits that could have been 
used. Rather than possessing rich deposits of electrum, Lydia had significant deposits of gold and silver. The decision to use electrum for 
coins, rather than pure gold or silver, was thus intentional, though we do not yet know why this was done. A plausible theory is that it was 
done to create a closed monetary economy within the kingdom. Electrum was also issued contemporaneously at various cities in Ionia and 
Caria, but all of these cities were under the influence of Lydia from the early seventh century, and certainly would have been constituent parts 
of the kingdom&apos;s economic sphere. 

The lion head/incuse coinage is among the earliest firmly attributed to the Lydian kingdom, and its origins date to the time of Alyattes, who 
ruled circa 620/10-564/53 BC. While most of the coins are anepigraphic, a small number of them bear the inscription Walwel or Kukalim 
in Lydian. Although these names likely equate to Alyattes and Gyges, respectively, studies have shown that these coins were not only 
contemporary with one another, but also with the anepigraphic issues. Thus, while Walwel may refer to the king, Kukalim most likely refers 
to another member of the royal family or some other high official.

At the time of Carradice&apos;s seminal article in BAR, there were no gold coins known for Type IV B, even though it is one of the most common 
in silver. This variety is differentiated from the others by the lack of indentations at the waistline of the figure on the obverse, and his dagger 
is pointed directly at his waist, rather than at a 45 degree angle to the ground. A handful finally appeared on the market around 2001. These 
have been commonly misattributed in sale catalogs as Type IV A.

B. Ockinga, &quot;The Crowned Ram&apos;s Head on Coins of Alexander the Great and the Rule of Ptolemy as Satrap of Egypt&quot; in P. Wheatly and

As their name implies, Gallic War staters were issued to fund the fight against Julius Caesar in Gaul. Two explanations for the blank obverse 
have been suggested: firstly, to signify that the coins were minted by a coalition of tribes -&apos;headless&apos; in other words -and, secondly, to speed 
up the production process, because the coins were often made in a hurry. The latter rationale seems to be more plausible.

Maaseno was the Kushan incarnation of the Hindu god Karttikeya, or Skanda, whose epithet was Mahasena. A particularly important deity to 
Yaudheyas, with his cult center at the Yaudheya capital of Rohitaka, it is highly probable that he entered the Kushan pantheon as a result of 
Kushan expansion into the territory of the Yaudheyas.

The presence of this type, bearing the legend Ka/cha below the left arm of the figure on the obverse, a position where other issues have the 
king&apos;s name, was problematic for early numismatists. In BMC Guptas, it was concluded that Kacha was probably a title for Samudragupta, 
and these coins were placed under that king. Later numismatic studies, such as Bayana and Alketar, have tended to identify a new king named 
Kacha. Although Samudragupta was the chosen heir of his father, Chandragupta I, he had several older brothers who were apparently passed-
over. It is now thought that Kacha, or Kachagupta, was one of these brothers, who was elevated as a rival king to his younger sibling. The 
overall scarcity of the coinage attests to the brevity of his reign, and the absence of his name from the historical record, save for these coins, 
cannot discount his existence, as many rulers are only known by their coins.

The chronology of the later issues based on the types of Kidara is still uncertain. While most must precede the capture of the mint by the 
Sasanians under Peroz in 467, some may have been revived thereafter. It is also possible that these coins were struck by the Alkhans, who may 
have taken Balkh from the Kidarites soon after they captured Gandhara in the early 5th century.

Ex V. Adda Collection (Christie&apos;s, 9 October 1984), lot 235, for a hammer of £800; Grand Duke George Mikhailovich Collection. 

The specimen illustrated in Frolova &amp; Ireland matches this piece nearly perfectly, except for the continuation of the circular border on the 
reverse, which, in the plate, appears to terminate at the base of the &apos;T&apos; in the date. This image was derived from the coin plated in Général A.L. 
Bertier&apos;s article &quot;О монетахъ властителей Боспора Киммерийкаго, опреде ляемыхъ монограммами,&quot; in Записки Одесского общества 
истории и древностей XXIX (Proceedings of the Odessa Society for History and Antiquity), which is listed as being in the collection of Grand 
Duke Mikhailovich. Since plates at that time were generally produced from casts of the coins, it is highly likely that minor edge characteristics 
would not be reproduced from the cast, leaving a slight difference from the original piece. Given the overwhelming similarity in the position 
of the strike on each side, it is all but certain that this example pedigrees to the Russian noble, a first cousin of Emperor Aleksandr III.

The referenced plate coin in Frolova &amp; Ireland reproduces the plate in Bertier&apos;s aforementioned article, and unfortunately doesn&apos;t provide 
enough detail to attribute conclusively this coin to the plated example. The overall positioning of the strike is a match, and many of the more 
minor details, such as flan cracks and light marks, may not clearly come through given early 20th-century coin plate production. If the present 
specimen is, in fact, the same as the one plated in Frolova &amp; Ireland and Bertier&apos;s article, it would also be pedigreed from Bertier&apos;s collection, 
as well as being cited in Anokhin.

Ex V. Adda Collection (Christie&apos;s, 8 October 1985), lot 318, for a hammer of £605. Possibly ex Grand Duke George Mikhailovich Collection. 

Bertier&apos;s article unfortunately does not plate an image for coin 84&apos;-which he lists as being from Mikhailovich&apos;s collection-and Frolova, 
citing only the Bertier specimen, accordingly has no image for this type and date. Similarly, an article published by Christian Christianovich 
Giel in Записки Русского археологического общества, entitled &quot;Новые приобретения моего собрания,&quot; mentions an example of this 
type and date, weighing 7.88 g (the same as the coin cited by Bertier), and also without an image. It is this latter specimen that Anokhin 
cites, without any mention of the former. Given the extreme rarity of the type and date, the proximity of the two collectors (Giel in 1892 and 
Mikhailovich in 1911), and the same recorded weight of the two specimens, it is this cataloger&apos;s opinion that the two citations may, in fact, 
be to the same coin, linking to this present coin, the minor difference in weight being explained by the slight imprecision of the tools of late 
19th/early 20th century.

The portrait on the reverse is cause for confusion, as the Bosporan mint lacked a portrait of Nerva shortly following that emperor&apos;s succession 
of Domitian in AD 96. As the Bosporan date on this coin places it in the 96/7 timeframe, it could be interpreted either as a portrait of 
Domitian during the last months of his reign, or a portrait of Nerva (with the features of Domitian) during the early months of his reign. 
Earlier scholarship listed the type simply as that of Nerva, but the similarity to the portrait of Domitian is overwhelming, and an open-ended 
attribution seems more appropriate.

Beginning in 608, the exarch of Africa and his son, both named Heraclius, began issuing coinage in opposition to that of the unpopular 
Byzantine emperor Phocas. This coinage named and depicted the Heraclii as consuls (though neither held the title at that time) rather than as 
emperors, a political move that promoted the Heraclii as champions of the people, not merely rivals to the throne. The revolt culminated with 
Heraclius the younger&apos;s coup at Constantinople in 610, where he was welcomed by the population, crowned, and saw to the execution of his 
predecessor. The solidi dated to indictional year 13 constitute the final gold issue of the revolt.

known. 
($3000) 

Ex Leu/Numismatica Ars Classica (26 May 1993), lot 435. 

The &quot;I&quot; on the reverse can only be interpreted as a date, which is supported by the light beard worn by Justinian on this final issue. If struck 
at Carthage, this solidus would have to predate the Umayyad capture of the city in late 695, and there is a good chance it was struck between 
Justinian&apos;s deposition and the arrival of the news of his overthrow at Carthage. As suggested in the Leu/NAC sale, however, it may have been 
struck at a &quot;branch mint&quot; set up by officials fleeing Carthage with bullion in advance of the Arab invasion, possibly at the outpost of Ceuta, 
which did not fall until 709. In any case, it seems likely that this was the last Byzantine solidus to be struck in Africa (postdating the dually 
dated year 10/9 solidi [MIB 18b; SB 1265B]), or at the very least, to be the last solidus struck by former workers of the Carthaginian mint. 

The Goldberg/Christov Family specimen, slightly inferior to the current piece, hammered at $4750. That sale mistakenly claimed the Leu/ 
NAC provenance of the present coin.

Ex John Work Garrett Collection (Part II, Leu/Numismatic Fine Arts, 16 October 1984), lot 537 (purchased from Wayte Raymond, 23 October

The Roman solidi and tremisses of Leo III feature a series of letters/numerals in the field, presumably dates either in regnal or indictional 
years. Bellinger and Grierson arranged the coinage according to the sequential order of these markings but warned that the arrangement leaves 
certain issues stylistically out of place (DOC p. 88 and 237). Concluding that there was no satisfactory explanation for the letters/numerals, 
the entire series was an assigned an overarching date of 721-741.

Grierson (DOC p. 417) discusses &quot;...the existence of contemporary imitations with blundered inscriptions and crude designs. On the 
assumption that they may have been semi-official -e.g., coins issued by the authorities in localities besieged by the Saracens or for some 
other reason deprived of their regular supply of coin -the specimens at Dumbarton Oaks have been catalogued below. One cannot, however, 
exclude the possibility of their having been struck by the Arabs, since they are very markedly &apos;globular.&apos; Invaders from North Africa would 
no doubt have occasionally seen seventh-century solidi of Carthage, and might well have thought this fabric appropriate for &apos;imperial&apos; coins.&quot;

Purchased from M. Louis Teller, August 1982. 

Citing the Freeman Collection coin as the only known specimen for his catalog 41(b) -a coin which did not have the small x at the end of the 
reverse legend -Miles&apos; initial inclination to reject the coin outright, based on the obverse bust type, was removed when he compared it to the 
specimen for catalog 41(a). Citing their inability to verify the authenticity of that coin, the authors of CNV did not include it in their catalog, 
and the author of MV, while including it in the list of specimens for the type, noted that he shared the same opinion as Miles. Nevertheless, the 
present coin, struck from the same obverse die as the Miles specimen, but a completely different reverse die, is clearly authentic and confirms 
the authenticity of the Miles coin as well.

This coin is highly unusual in that it combines a stylized Nike reverse typical of issues from Lombardy in the name of Maurice Tiberius, 
but it is clearly in the name of Heraclius and recalls Heraclean imitations minted in Tuscany that feature a cross potent on the reverse. It is 
not entirely clear if our piece was struck in Lombardy or Tuscany. If the former, it would support Grierson&apos;s theory that both regions struck 
coinage concurrently.

Like the previous lot, this coin mixes elements of the tremisses of Lombardy and Tuscany: the use of Maurice&apos;s name on the obverse is typical 
of Lombardy, while the cross potent reverse of the types in the name of Heraclius, with which this coin must be contemporary, is characteristic 
of Tuscan issues.

This coin features a highly enigmatic obverse legend which defies explanation (the &quot;P&quot; and &quot;I&quot; at the beginning of &quot;PIЄPII&quot; seem reasonably 
clear but are open to interpretation). It is possibly the earliest issue in the name of Cunincpert, which was followed by coinage with the ruler&apos;s 
name on both obverse and reverse (cf. Arslan 31-33). 

Commenting on the bizarre obverse legend in a letter to Dr. Adams, Philip Grierson wrote &quot;...one would expect either LANGOBARDVM 
or some epithet like perpetuus, Dei Gratia, iustus, pius (I do not think a provincial or place name is possible). But there is nothing obvious, 
unless PREPET for PERPET.&quot;

Ex Schweizerische Kreditanstalt (20 April 1985), lot 788. 

The hand, in place of letters, appears on some of the tremisses of Cunincpert, Aripert II, and Liutprand. It has been suggested, somewhat 
fancifully, that the symbol was placed on the coins as a reminder to forgers of the penalty they would incur for violating Rothari&apos;s Edict of 643 
(&quot;He who stamps gold or mints coin without the king&apos;s command shall have his hand cut off&quot;). The traditional view is that it serves as a mint 
or mintmaster&apos;s mark, as the letters surely do. Another possibility is that it represents the manus Dei, although its position before the portrait 
rather than above would be peculiar.

Wroth (BMC Vandals) believed this type dated to the reign of Gisulf II, a claim that was corroborated by Oddy. However, the fact that the 
traditional initials were omitted from the reverse field in favor of a hand suggests that this coin was issued by an uncertain, non-regal authority. 

All known specimens of this issue appear to be struck from the same obverse die. Most of these likely originated from a hoard discovered in 
Benevento around 1878 (BMC Vandals, p. 191 note).

From part of what must have been a very small issue of Italian imitative solidi copying Constans II. Hahn&apos;s coin X1 in Naples has a distinct 
monogram copied from the Rome mint in the reverse field, but otherwise this coin comports closely with it, both stylistically and with the 
inclusion of the distinctive spelling of VTORIA. In the Garrett sale the cataloguer noted that the coin had Ravennate features, particularly 
the thick reverse border, but as the coin does not share any characteristics of the known Lombard issues of northern Italy, it was suggested it 
belongs to Spoletium, a duchy in central Italy that otherwise lacked its own coinage.

A difficult coin to assign with much certainty. The Peus cataloger gave it to the Ticinum mint under the Ostrogothic King Baduila (541-552), 
presumably following Wroth&apos;s (BMC pp. 84-5, 2-13) attribution of finer-style specimens. Kent (&quot;Coinage of Theoderic in the names of 
Anastasius and Justin I,&quot; Essays Baldwin, p. 69) suggested that the abbreviated form of the end of the obverse legend, with a single P (see 
especially BMC 5 and 8), was particularly characteristic of the mint of Milan. The unusually simplistic style and blundered legends on the 
current coin, however, may point to this being a degenerate copy (perhaps Merovingian?) of an Ostrogothic issue.

Presumably struck in Italy and thus likely Lombardic. In the Garrett sale, where a south Italian origin was suggested, it is noted that: &quot;This coin 
appears to imitate issues from Rome but seems to have no certain relations. Hahn&apos;s coins are rather similar: see especially X4 with the very 
much abbreviated legends and the peculiar treatment of the globi held by the figures on the rev. (which have the appearance of the pommels

While the obverse of this local imitation is exceptionally crude, the reverse legend, a meaningless string of the letters V, I, and O, as well as 
the abbreviated mintmark &quot;ONO,&quot; are very characteristic of Lombardic issues from Tuscany (see, for example, lot 384 above, and MEC 1,

According to D.J. Henstra (The Evolution of the Money Standard in Medieval Frisia [Gronigen, 2000]), the Merovingians occupied Frisia 
circa 630, whereupon the mintmasters Madelinus and Rimoaldus struck their respective gold coinages. Around 650, the Frisians reconquered 
their territories, and continued to strike tremisses based on the Dorestat type of Madelinus, though likely at a mint removed from Dorestat. 
These imitations were quickly debased, until full silver deniers replaced the tremisses, circa 680. The Merovingians captured Dorestat again 
circa 689, and reestablished their mint there. It was around this time that the production of the silver deniers based on the Madelinus type 
ended.

Desiderius (757-774), the last Lombardic king of Lombardy, had created for the first time a unified coinage, with a number of mints all striking 
&quot;cross potent/star&quot; tremisses (see lots 398 and 399, below). For the first five years of his reign, Desiderius pursued a policy of friendship 
toward the Franks, culminating in 770 with the marriage of his daughter to Charlemagne, but relations soon deteriorated when Charlemagne 
annulled the marriage the following year and sent the Lombard princess back to Italy. After the death of his brother Carloman in 771, 
Charlemagne seized his territory and proclaimed himself sole king of the Franks. Carloman&apos;s widow and sons sought refuge with Desiderius 
just as the Lombardic king began an offensive against Pope Hadrian I. Consequently, Hadrian appealed to Charlemagne for help in late 772. In 
773, the Frankish king crossed the Alps, successfully besieged the Lombard capital of Pavia, and took the last Lombardic king and his queen 
as prisoners to France in 774. Charlemagne received the title of &quot;Patrician of the Romans&quot; and took for himself the crown of the Lombards, 
now in the treasury of Monza Cathedral.

The Solidus Mancusus in Italy

The solidus mancusus, popularly known as mancus, was a term used in early medieval Europe to denote a gold coin, a weight of gold, or a 
unit of account of thirty silver pence. Distinguishing among these three meanings can be extremely difficult, as is evidenced by a request in 
the will of the Anglo-Saxon king Eadred, which states that &quot;two-thousand mancuses be taken and minted into mancuses.&quot; Even the origin 
of the word is in doubt. One possible source is the late Latin word for &quot;defective&quot; (mancus), possibly a reference to the base gold coins 
circulating in northern Europe during the mid-eighth century AD. However, accounts of contemporary payments in mancuses occurring in 
north-eastern Italy refer specifically to payment in Islamic gold dinars. Consequently, mancus more likely derives from the Arabic word for 
&quot;struck&quot; (manqush). 

In northern Europe and Italy during the early eighth century AD, the silver denier was the medium of exchange. The last regular gold coinage 
in use in those areas had been the tremisses of either the Visigothic or Merovingian kings, or the Byzantine issues struck at Italian mints. With 
the renewal of long-distance transactions requiring the use of large sums, gold coinage was reintroduced in the form of Islamic dinars. Already 
an accepted form of gold currency, these dinars were copied by northern Italian mints in order to facilitate their burgeoning trading enterprises. 
Soon other areas of northern Europe began to strike similar imitations, so that between the ninth and eleventh centuries the mancus became 
the standard gold coinage used in Western Europe. In some areas, such as Britain and Carolingian Francia, the mancus would employ local 
designs, reflecting a specific and special reason for issuing this denomination. Most, however, were careful copies of Abbasid dinars. The 
precise significance for the copying of this particular type remains uncertain, but it appears that by the late eighth century, northern Italy and 
Europe were poised to re-establish an international trade with the rest of the Mediterranean, something that had disappeared with the collapse 
of Roman power in the fifth century AD.

These coins were issued for trade purposes in Frisia and must have been produced over a considerable period of time. This coin can be dated 
by the presence in the Delfzijl Hoard of silver deniers of Charles the Fat struck between 882 and 887. The dies themselves may have been cut 
much earlier and reused.

Grierson classifies the imitative solidi of Louis the Pious according to 29 types. Although varying greatly by the competence of the engraver 
and quality of the gold, the imitations cited do share some common features. They often have a legend in which at least some part of the name 
of Louis can be discerned, ...VVDOV... or a variation thereof, and the cross on the reverse is usually enclosed within a wreath with a trefoil 
tie. Additionally, the reverse &quot;legend&quot; usually has an O at or near the 12 o&apos;clock position. The present coin does not display any of these 
features, and in general appears more crude than the published examples. The iterated VIIT resembles the fragmentary legends of continental 
&quot;Frisian&quot; sceats of a century earlier. By the time of Louis the Pious, this had simply become a generalized coin legend that had been copied 
for generations. These and other extremely rare Carolingian gold solidi had little long term impact on the economy or coinage system, and it 
would be several more centuries, with the introduction of the Venetian ducat and the Florentine florin, that gold would play a significant role 
in the western economy.

The Venetian style imitative ducati copying the types such as Andrea Dandolo are traditionally attributed to Robert d&apos;Anjou (de Taranto) as 
the Prince of Achaea, but their widespread circulation and their numerous varieties leaves open the possibility of other minting sites, such 
as Chios under Genoa or Mytilene under the Gattilusi, as these venues served as the principal trade currency of the Crusader east for several 
decades in the last half of the 14th century.

The mid 19th century saw two famous Gold Rushes within a few years of each other, one in California and the second in Australia. The 
Australian Edward Hargraves was unsuccessful in finding his fortune among the &quot;49ers,&quot; but he did come away with the conviction that 
the geology of the California gold fields matched that of areas of his native New South Wales. In February 1851 Hargraves struck gold at 
Summerhill Creek, NSW, to be followed a few months later by additional strikes in the state of Victoria. The Rush was on. Tens of thousands 
of prospectors poured into the gold fields, from the rest of Australia and around the world. Ironically this sudden discovery of vast wealth 
caused immense disruption to the nascent Australian economy. Towns and cities were virtually deserted as fortune hunters abandoned their 
homes and jobs, taking most of the already scarce circulating currency with them. 

The situation became quite critical in Adelaide, the capital of South Australia, when a shipment of gold bullion arrived at the assay office in 
January 1852. The governor, Sir Henry Young, and the provincial legislature determined to alleviate the shortage of coinage by authorizing the 
striking of gold ingots. The ingots were less than successful, the people demanding proper coinage instead. In November 1852 an amendment 
to the bullion act authorized the striking of of £1, £2 and £5 coins. To circumvent the law against private minting of coins without royal 
approval, these pieces were still officially termed &quot;ingots.&quot; Joshua Payne made dies for £1 and £5 coins, and began striking the 1 pound 
denomination. After some 50 pieces were struck, the reverse die cracked and was rendered unusable. A second, rather less elegant reverse die 
was hurriedly prepared, and ultimately a total of 24,768 £1 coins were struck. No original £5 coins are known, although a handful of restrikes 
were made from the original dies in 1919. 

Meanwhile, the £1 coins had entered circulation to general acclaim, which only grew louder when it was discovered that the gold content of 
the new coins was £1/1-/10 1/2p. Thousands went back into the melting pot, at a good profit to the owners. Finally, in mid-1853 word reached 
Adelaide from the Colonial Office in London. Their petition to strike a provincial coinage was denied by Her Majesty&apos;s government. The 
Adelaide mint was shut down, and the few coins remaining in official coffers were melted down. Of Australia&apos;s first coinage issue, less than 
200 examples are believed to have survived, with perhaps 20 of these being the rare type I.

The coinage of Norodom I is traditionally divided into &quot;original&quot; and &quot;restrike&quot; issues struck at Birmingham, Brussels, or Phnom Penh. 
However, examination of mint records suggests that the date 1860 in fact represents the accession date of the ruler and not, as is custom, the 
date of issue. It is likely that the first issues of the series were struck in 1875, when new presses were delivered to Cambodia, and continued 
to be struck sporadically in both the native Cambodian and European mints until the late 19th century. The series has yet to be studied closely 
enough to allow individual issues to be assigned to the various mints, but it would appear that at least the pieces struck from very worn dies 
can be attributed to Cambodia.

Empress Zewditu ascended the throne in 1917 following the deposition of Lij Yasu. She was largely a figurehead, however, with the regent 
Ras Tafari (the future Haile Selassie) possessing real power. As such, it appears to have been considered prudent to keep Zewditu&apos;s coinage 
limited in size, while coins of Menelik II continued to be struck during her reign. The obverse dies for the empress&apos; coins were made in Paris 
and were sent to Addis Ababa where they were wedded with reverse dies used for the Menelik coinage. In order to emphasize that these were 
presentation pieces rather than regular issues, the denominational markings were frequently -and quite crudely -effaced from the reverse 
dies. Coins with the value preserved in the exergue as on the current piece command a higher premium.

This and the following ½ werk were part of Haile Selassie&apos;s plan to reform the Ethiopia&apos;s monetary system with the introduction of gold 
coinage. The new coinage was abandoned, however, following the financial crisis of 1931, after which many countries abandoned the gold 
standard.

Although Genoa was supposed to be an autonomous city, the inability of its doges to defend its sovereignty allowed the French monarchy, who 
saw such control as key to involvement in the affairs of Italy, to bring the city under their rule. Beginning in 1499, Louis XII seized control of 
Milan, ousting the ruling Sforzas. As a result, the French king also gained control of Genoa and established himself there as doge. 

In 1508, under the leadership of Pope Julius II, the French and Genoese joined with the Holy Roman Empire and Spain in the League Cambrai 
against Venice. The League&apos;s inability to follow up their successes, and the Pope&apos;s growing distrust of the French, caused that alliance to soon 
fall apart. Beginning in 1510, the Holy League was formed, an alliance of the Pope, Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, and England against 
Louis XII. The stunning French victory under Gaston de Foix at Ravenna in 1512 was quickly overshadowed by the duke&apos;s death during that 
battle. At the same time, the Swiss invasion of Milan compelled Louis, for the time, to withdraw completely from Italy and await a future 
opportunity to once again enter the fray.

($2000) 

Ex Classical Numismatic Group 84 (5 May 2010), lot 1788. 

The obverse of this coin is stylistically similar to contemporary São Tomés of Goa (see CNG 82, lot 1282 [listed as Filipe I]) -although with 
the G A (the mint signature for Goa) being replaced by the letters M A (the mint signature of Malacca) -as well as the silver Meio Bastiao 
issues of that mint for Sebastião. Likewise, the reverse design parallels the Goa mint copper 2 Bazarucos issues for the same king (cf. Gomes 
14.01 and 15.01). Such a connection between the mints of Portuguese Goa and Malacca makes good sense, since it was the Portuguese 
governor of India, Afonso de Albuquerque who, in 1511, following the earlier establishment of a mint at Goa, used the territory as a base from 
which to launch his conquest of Malacca. Once completed, de Albuquerque established a mint there as well in order to facilitate Portuguese 
trade in the Indian Ocean with a more available supply of coinage (which had been the pretext for de Albuquerque&apos;s conquest of Malacca).

Dr. Adams writes: &quot;In 1891, the Volksraad of the ZAR passed legislation authorizing a coinage system which would bear the likeness of 
President Kruger. The general election was to be held in 1893 and President Kruger was anxious to have these coins in circulation prior to the 
election. As the new mint in Pretoria was still being built and he did not want to wait until it was operative, he contracted for the first coins 
of the series to be minted at the Kaisermint in Berlin. This act nearly cost him the election and became a source of ridicule by his opponent. 
Instead of the traditional Voortrekker wagon (with a single shaft and rear wheels larger than the front wheels), the pond, half pond, and silver 
crown bore a continental wagon with two shafts and front and rear wheels of the same diameter on the ZAR coat-of-arms. This insult to the 
Dutch was further compounded when the coin designer, Otto Schultz, put his initials OS on the bust of Kruger. Although this merely followed 
an established custom, it proved embarrassing to Kruger since OS is also the Dutch word for ox. 

As many as possible of the OS/double shaft coins were removed from circulation and melted down, and new ponds and crowns with a single 
shaft and no initials were issued later in 1892. Kruger, however, did win the election by a narrow majority.&quot;

The large series of pseudo-medieval medals, long known as &apos;Judenmedaille&apos; from their supposed manufacture by Jewish minters in Prague, 
were actually part of a very carefully thought out series designed to glorify the ancestors of the House of Hapsburg. They appear in different

The China trade was initially a remarkably one-sided affair, with a staggering demand for Chinese goods in the west, but scant need for 
western goods in China. But in the early 19th century, the British finally found a popular commodity and began to trade Indian opium to the 
Chinese in exchange for silver. This caused a reversal in flow of specie: where once New World and European silver flowed into China to pay 
for tea and porcelain, filling the Qing coffers, Chinese silver now flowed west to pay for addictive opium. With the drug not only weakening 
the minds of the populace, but also the treasury of the state, China banned the trade in opium in 1839, ordering all stocks seized. 

British merchants found the prohibition of such a popular trade good unacceptable and the situation soon escalated to war. Unfortunately for 
the Chinese, the Royal navy&apos;s steamships and modern rifles soundly defeated the antiquated Qing forces. The war ended in 1842, beginning 
what is known as the &quot;Century of Humiliation&quot; for the Chinese. The Treaty of Nanking forced them to cede to the British the city of Hong 
Kong, as well as pay an indemnity of 21 million dollars in silver. So much silver was paid to the British that, when it was melted down at the 
Royal mint, enough gold was extracted to permit the striking of a series of small medals.
