AUCTION TERMS 

This is a public, mail bid, and internet auction conducted by Classical 
Numismatic Group, Inc. (CNG). Bidding in the auction constitutes 
acceptance of the following terms: 

1. 
The property listed in this catalogue is offered for sale by 
CNG for itself and as agent for various owners and other consignors. 
We reserve the right to reject any bid, to determine the opening price, 
to set bidding increments, to vary the order of the auction, to reopen 
bidding in the case of a dispute, to withdraw any lot, to bid on behalf 
of CNG, to bid on behalf of the consignor, to permit the auctioneer to 
bid on his own behalf, and to permit the consignor to bid on his own 
lots. CNG may loan or advance money to consignors or prospective 
bidders, and may have an interest other than commission charges in 
any lot. CNG may bid on its own account as an &quot;insider&quot; with infor-
mation not available to the public. 

2. 
A buyer&apos;s fee will be charged to all successful bidders as fol-
lows on the hammer price: 
A. 21% for written, fax, email, telephone, and live internet bids. 
B. 19% for floor bids placed in person at the auction and electronic 
bids placed directly on www.cngcoins.com. 
All written bids, email bids, non-live telephone bids, live internet bid 
registrations, and live telephone bid registrations must be received 
before 5PM Eastern time on the day before the auction begins. CNG 
reserves the right to change the format of www.cngcoins.com at any 
time. 

3. 
All coins are guaranteed genuine. Attribution, date, condi-
tion, and other descriptions are the opinion of the cataloguer, and no 
warranty is expressed or implied. Please note that an auction sale 
is not an approval sale. Lots examined prior to the sale and lots 
purchased by floor bidders (including bidders executing commission 
bids on behalf of other parties) may not be returned for any reason 
except lack of authenticity. All claims of misdescription and all 
claims of return, except claims regarding authenticity, must be made 
within 5 days of receipt of material. Any claim of lack of authenticity 
must be made in writing by the original purchaser immediately after 
discovery that an item is not authentic, and upon making such a claim 
the original purchaser must immediately return the lot to CNG in the 
same condition as at the time of the auction. Coins that have been 
encapsulated (&quot;slabbed&quot;) by a grading and/or authentication service 
may not be returned for any reason, including authenticity, if they 
have been removed from the encapsulation (&quot;slab&quot;). If payment is 
made by credit card, rights of return are governed by these Auction 
Terms which supercede any rights of return promulgated by the card 
issuer. Estimates are intended as a guide only and not as a statement 
of opinion of value. 

4. 
Invoices are due and payable immediately upon receipt. 
Interest and late fees of 2.0% per month, or at the highest rate permit-
ted by law, whichever is less, from the date of the auction, shall be 
payable on invoices not settled within 30 days of the auction date. 
Payment may be made by check or bank wire. Credit cards (Visa 
or MasterCard) will be accepted; credit card payments will not be 
accepted more than 14 days after the sale date. Payment by check 
must be made in either US dollars ($) drawn on a US bank or British 
sterling (£) drawn on a British bank. All successful bidders outside 
North America and the United Kingdom will be charged an additional 
$20 fee for bank charges that are the result of international wire trans-
fer fees; this fee will be deducted for credit card or check payment as 
described above. CNG may reduce or compromise any charge or fee 
at its discretion. 

5. 
Bidders not known to us must provide us with satisfactory 
credit references or pay a deposit as determined at CNG&apos;s discretion 
before bidding. Minors are not permitted to bid without written con-
sent of a parent guaranteeing payment. CNG may require payment 
in full from any bidder prior to delivery of lots. Title does not pass 
until lots are paid in full. Upon receipt of lots, the buyer assumes full 
responsibility for loss or damage. Delivery to the buyer&apos;s address of 
record shall constitute receipt by the buyer regardless of the identity 
of the person accepting delivery. 

6. 
Estimates are in U.S. dollars ($US) and bids must be in 
even dollar ($) amounts. CNG will execute mail bids on behalf of 
mail bidders. Subject to reserves and opening prices, mail bids will be 
executed at one bidding increment (approximately 10%) over the next 
highest bid. In the case of identical bids, the earliest bid wins. A mail 
bid has priority over an identical floor bid. Bid by lot number. No lots 
will be broken. Bidders are responsible for errors in bidding. Check 
your bid sheet carefully. 

7. 
All lots are subject to reserve unless otherwise indicated. 
However, no reserve will be higher than the estimate, and ordinarily 
lots are reserved at 60% of estimate. 

8. 
Bidders personally guarantee payment for their successful 
bids, including bidders executing commission bids from other parties 
and bidders representing corporations or other entities. Buyers accept-
ing commission bids from other parties do so at their own risk and 
remain responsible for payment under these Auction Terms. 

9. 
At the conclusion of bidding for each lot, the sale contract is 
concluded and the successful bidder becomes liable for immediate 
payment under these Auction Terms. In the event a successful bidder 
fails to make full payment within 30 days of the auction date, CNG 
reserves the right either: (a) to require payment as provided under 
these Auction Terms; or (b) to deem the sale incomplete and to re-auc-
tion the material, in which case the successful bidder agrees to pay for 
the reasonable cost of such a sale and also to pay any shortfall between 
the re-auction price and the successful bidder&apos;s purchase price. CNG 
reserves all rights that it is entitled to under the Pennsylvania Uniform 
Commercial Code, including the right to offset any sums due from a 
successful bidder against any future consignment or purchase or mon-
ies or goods in possession of CNG. 

10. 
Sales tax, postage, handling and insurance are the responsibil-
ity of the buyer and are added to all invoices where appropriate. For 
buyers in the European Union, CNG may import lots into the United 
Kingdom prior to shipment and charge buyers the import Value Added 
Tax. On any tax not paid by the purchaser which should have been 
paid, even if not invoiced by CNG, the purchaser agrees to pay the 
same on demand together with any interest or penalty that may be 
assessed. It is the responsibility of the buyer to comply with foreign 
customs and other regulations. 

11. 
Prices realized are published after the sale and are mailed with 
CNG&apos;s next publication. Prices realized are also posted after the sale 
on CNG&apos;s web site: www.cngcoins.com 

12. 
Bidders hereby waive any claim for incidental, consequential 
or exemplary damages arising from this auction. The sole remedy that 
any participant in the auction shall have for any claim or controversy 
arising out of the auction shall be a refund, without interest, of all or 
part of the purchase price paid by the participant. 

13. 
All rights granted by CNG or otherwise available to bidders 
and purchasers, under these Auction Terms or otherwise, are personal 
and may not be assigned or transferred to any other person or entity, 
whether by operation of law or otherwise. No third party may rely on 
any benefit or right conferred by these Auction Terms. Bidders acting 
as agents must disclose the agency in writing to CNG prior to the auc-
tion; otherwise rights are limited to the agent and are not transferable 
to the undisclosed principal. 

14. 
Any dispute regarding this auction shall be governed by the 
laws of Pennsylvania and shall be adjudicated only by the Lancaster 
County Court of Common Pleas or the U.S. District Court for the 
Eastern District of Pennsylvania; all bidders submit themselves to 
the personal jurisdiction of these courts for this purpose, consent 
to service of process by registered or certified mail, and waive any 
contrary provisions of Articles 14 or 15 of the French Civil Code and 
any similar provisions in any jurisdiction. All bidders consent to the 
confidentiality of consignors&apos; identities and waive any right to require 
disclosure of the name of the consignor or owner of any auction lot, 
whether such right is based on New York GOL  §5-701(a) or any other 
provision in any jurisdiction. In any dispute regarding this auction, the 
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and 
attorney fees.

The Dr. Lawrence A. Adams Collection 

Dr. Lawrence (Larry) Alexander Adams was born on May 
31, 1935 in Los Angeles, California, the son of Alexander 
and Lucille (née Spiker) Adams. His father was a salesman 
in the Wholesale Market and Restaurant business. Dr. 
Adams died unexpectedly on March 24, 2015, just a couple 
of months short of what would have been his 80th birthday. 
Larry is survived by Meredith (née Nieboer) Adams, his 
wife of 54 years. A prominent Dermatologist specializing in 
Dermatologic Surgery (Mohs-Micrographic Surgery), Larry 
worked his entire professional career for Kaiser Permanente 
in the Greater Los Angeles area. 

Larry received both his undergraduate degree and then his 
medical education at Loyola University of Chicago, the 
Stritch School of Medicine, graduating with his M.D. in 1960. 
He did his internship through the Veterans Administration 
Los Angeles Healthcare System in 1960-1; his residency in General Surgery at the University 
of Missouri-Columbia in 1961-2; and his residency in Dermatology at the McGaw Medical 
School of Northwestern University from 1964-7. Larry practiced medicine in California from 
1965 right up until his death in March of 2015, primarily at the Southern California Permanente 
Medical Group, Panorama City Medical Center. 

Besides medicine and his family, Larry&apos;s third passion in life was numismatics, which he began 
pursuing in the 1960s. A friend of Larry&apos;s, Don Corrigan (the son of famous aviator Douglas 
&quot;Wrong-way&quot; Corrigan), advised Larry to purchase only gold coins, and Larry followed this 
advice throughout his collecting career. He purchased gold coinage from ancient to modern, 
with an emphasis on the Middle East, the Early Middle Ages, and the Ptolemies of Egypt. He 
had specialized collections of Kushan, Kushano-Sasanian, Indian (an extensive collection), 
and Bosporan gold coinage. He liked Dutch gold coinage, as his wife is of Dutch ancestry, and 
he collected French gold pattern coinage. Over the last few years, he had started to collect gold 
medals, particularly those from Latin America. In short, if it was gold, and numismatically 
related, Larry probably collected it! He had a &quot;good eye&quot; for coins, and rarity was more 
important to Larry than quality, the mark of a &quot;true&quot; collector and numismatist. 

Larry belonged to many numismatic clubs and organizations, both locally and nationally, but he 
was especially proud of his membership in the &quot;Sunday Morning Get Together&quot;, a numismatic 
breakfast group founded by Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Lissner, Irving &quot;Irv&quot; Goodman, and M. Louis 
&quot;Mark&quot; Teller. Larry joined the group within the first year of its formation. Composed of 
serious, committed numismatists, this &quot;club&quot; grew to become a &quot;who&apos;s who&quot; of prominent 
collectors in the greater Los Angeles area. Members included Dr. Osmund Chan, Dr. Robert 
Hesselgesser, Dr. Vladimir Golovchinsky and Paul Covey from San Antonio, Texas. Victor 
England would sometimes join the group when travelling through the area, and wives, children, 
and grandchildren were always welcomed as guests. 

Another organization that Larry was quite active in was the Society of Ancient Numismatics 
(or SAN). Larry contributed several articles to the SAN Journal, and eventually became the 


7 

publisher of the Journal in 1995. Larry, along with the assistance of David Vagi and Victor 
England, continued to publish the SAN Journal until 2002. 

Larry was also active in the American Numismatic Society (ANS), which he joined in 1982. 
He became a Fellow of the ANS in 1997, and a Trustee in 2001. He served on the Finance 
and Collections committees, and was a member of the Augustus B. Sage Society, an exclusive 
group for the most serious, dedicated members of the ANS. 

Professionally, Larry was the West Coast Representative for the Classical Numismatic Group 
from 1995 until his death. Larry was a fixture at the CNG bourse table at the New York 
International Numismatic Convention, the Chicago International Coin Fair, and the annual 
summer convention of the American Numismatic Association. He represented CNG at most of 
the numismatic bourses in the San Francisco area. If CNG did not have a table at a numismatic 
convention, Larry was often behind the table of Mark Teller and Company. 

Larry purchased coins from most of the leading dealers throughout his numismatic career, 
but relied primarily on CNG (Victor England and Eric McFadden), Mark Teller, and Stephen 
Album for the majority of his purchases. Larry loved to talk coins, and interacted at shows 
and club meetings with collectors and dealers that shared his passion. If a dealer (or collector) 
was visiting the Los Angeles area, Larry and Meredith would often meet them for dinner and 
numismatic conversation. 

The collection of Dr. Lawrence A. Adams will be sold by Classical Numismatic Group in a 
series of sales: several of the firm&apos;s electronic online auctions; CNG 100, an Internet and Mail 
Bid Sale scheduled for 7 October 2015; and Triton XIX, to be sold in conjunction with the 
44th Annual New York International Numismatic Convention on Tuesday and Wednesday, 
5-6 January 2016. Some of Larry&apos;s favorite numismatic auction catalogs were the sales of the 
Virgil M. Brand Collection, sold by Sotheby&apos;s in Zurich, Switzerland in ten parts from July 
of 1982 to October of 1985. As a tribute to Larry and the significance of his collection, CNG 
is following in the tradition of the Brand sales and presenting the Dr. Lawrence A. Adams 
Collection in four separate catalogs using the Brand catalog format. </preface>

scene shows the great sea-god, Poseidon, seated on a diphros, leaning forward toward his son Taras, who reaches up to him. Interpretations 
of this scene have varied based on the datings that numismatists have assigned to this issue. It was clear that the issue belonged to the second 
half of the fourth century BC, and there has been a traditional thought that gold coinage at that time was often struck for payments made 
during times of crisis. Most numismatists also agreed that the scene depicted an act of appeal by Tarentum, represented by Taras, to a foreign 
power, represented by Poseidon. M.P. Vlasto, C.M. Kraay, and G.K. Jenkins thought that Poseidon, the father of Taras, was meant to represent 
Sparta, the parent city of Tarentum, and thus the issue was related to the intervention of the Spartans at the behest of Tarentum circa 344-338 
BC. Other numismatists, most notably, N.K. Rutter, thought that the appeal belonged to the intervention of Alexander the Molossian, circa 
334-332 BC. In contrast to these traditional interpretations, W. Fischer-Bossert&apos;s reassessment of the entire coinage at Tarentum has concluded 
that this lovely issue was struck somewhat later, circa 320 BC, based on his analysis of the hoards containing this type, as well as typological 
and epigraphical links to various silver issues, whose dates of issue are more certain. While the city lacked a significant crisis during this 
time, the conditions did not preclude the striking of a gold coinage. We know that Tarentum experienced a time of high prosperity during this 
period, attested by the colossal statues of Zeus and Herakles that the artist Lysippos of Sikyon made there to symbolize the city&apos;s leadership 
of the local Greek federation. In such a time of tranquility, then, this issue of gold staters may have played a part in the custom of gift-giving 
between the city&apos;s leaders and foreign dignitaries. In this light, the reverse scene symbolizes the mythological origin of the city. The obverse 
type, Persephone, depicts the city&apos;s patron goddess, and also alludes to the source of the city&apos;s great wealth, its grain trade. 

Chronological considerations aside, this issue of gold staters at Tarentum has long been regarded as being among the finest examples of 
numismatic art. B.V. Head remarked that the type was &quot;one of the most beautiful in the Tarentine series&quot; (PCG p. 44, 7), Kraay noted that it 
was &quot;remarkable not only for its artistic quality but also for theme of its reverse type&quot; (ACGC p. 191), Jenkins said that &quot;the composition has 
considerable charm as a genre scene and is brilliantly engraved&quot; (Ancient Greek Coins, p. 118), and Holloway placed the type among &quot;the 
most majestic examples of Tarentine gold coinage&quot; (Art and Coinage in Magna Graecia, p. 39).

The Brettii were an indigenous Italian people who emerged in southern Italy in the mid-fourth century BC. Ancient authors describe them 
as a group of revolted slaves and miscellaneous fugitives who came together after seeking refuge in the rugged mountains of the area. 
Nonetheless, it is more likely that most of these people were native Oenotrians or Pelasgians who had escaped from domination by the Greek 
cities and other native groups to the north. By the mid-third century BC, this disparate congregation of people, now known as the Brettii, had 
become the predominant power over most of Italy south of the river Laos, including the important mints of Consentia, Medma, Hipponium, 
Terina, and Thurium (Diod. XVI.15; Strabo VI). Their rising power, however, was eventually checked by the expansion of Roman authority 
in their region. In the 280s BC, they united with their neighbors, the Lucanians, against Rome, an adventure that proved inconclusive. Soon 
thereafter, they aided Pyrrhos in his war against Rome, an unsuccessful endeavor that resulted in the Romans carrying on the conflict against 
the Brettians after defeating the Epiran leader. The Brettians submitted to the Romans, but in the face of Hannibal&apos;s successes against Rome, 
they again allied themselves with Rome&apos;s enemy during the Second Punic War (Livy XXII. 61). In this conflict, the Brettians were completely 
invested in the alliance with Carthage, such that the entire region of Bruttium became a veritable Punic fortress, and it was during this war 
that the entire series of Brettian coinage was struck. Once again, though, the Brettii had supported the losing side, and this time the Romans 
were determined to squash any further ability of the Brettians to threaten them. In the aftermath of Hannibal&apos;s defeat, the Romans subjugated 
Bruttium through annual military deployments and the establishment of three colonies, at Tempsa, Kroton, and Vibo Valentia (Livy XXXIV. 
45 and XXXV. 40). Unlike other Italian populations that had been conquered by the Romans, the Brettii were also not admitted as Roman 
allies and could not serve in the Roman military (Appian, Annib. 61). Little is known of the Brettii thereafter, but in the early to mid-first 
century BC, Bruttium was further laid waste during the revolt of Spartacus and the war between Sextus Pompey and Octavian (Plut. Crass. 
10-11; Appian, B.C. IV. 86, V. 19 and 91).

The magistrate&apos;s name, Silanos, is found on tetradrachms (SNG ANS 1000) as well as gold diobols with marks of value. As it does so 
often, gold indicates anticipation of an emergency, and thus this last issue of the city can be dated to the period before its capitulation to the 
Carthaginians in 406 BC (see C. Boehringer, &quot;Die Finanzpolitik und Münzprägung des Dionysios von Syrakus,&quot; Essays Thompson, pp. 15-6). 
It is thought that this particular gold issue was struck to pay the mercenaries who defended the city against the Punic forces. It is also the only 
issue of Akragas to feature a magistrate&apos;s name.

Sosipolis appears as a male name in Greek texts, but the figure that appears named as such on Geloan coins is clearly female. She has been 
variously identified with a water nymph, a Tyche (patron goddess of a city), a Nike (goddess of Victory), and Demeter. Likely regarded as 
a multi-faceted goddess combining many attributes, she was protectress of the city of Gela. Her first appearance is in the 440s, crowning 
the bull of Gela with a wreath, signaling a victory over the native Sikels by a combined Greek army in which Gela played a significant role. 
Her second, and last, mention is a more somber occasion, a plea for divine intervention on an emergency coinage struck as Gela and many 
other Greek cities in the west and south of Sicily fell to the Carthaginians at the end of the 5th century BC. For a discussion of the dating 
of this issue, see C. Boehringer, &quot;Die Finanzpolitik und Münzprägung des Dionysios von Syrakus&quot; in Essays Thompson, pp. 15-17 and C.

This coin is a true enigma, since it is difficult to connect its issue to any specific historical event. The similar use of the curved retrograde 
sigmas in the ethnic as well as the style of the leaf in the exergue of the obverse links this coin to Caltabiano Series VII tetradrachms whose 
production ended in 450 BC. Carmen Arnold-Biucchi dated the beginning of this tetradrachm series (and consequently this gold issue) to 461 
BC, a date which Caltabiano reduced by a decade. 

As such rare gold issues of Magna Graecia and Sicily tend to be struck only as a military necessity, the purpose of this extremely rare dilitron 
issue must be some war in which Messana was involved. One intriguing possibility involves Douketios, a local Sikel leader who, according to 
Diodoros Siculus (11.76.3, 78.5, 88.6, 91.1), took advantage of the political vacuum caused by the creation of the Fifth Democracy in Syracuse 
to establish a state on the eastern portion of the island. Beginning in 461 BC and continuing until his death in 440 BC, Douketios expanded his 
influence from his base of operations in the rugged hill country northwest of Syracuse by taking advantage of the numerous inter city rivalries. 
In 461 BC, he sided with Syracuse against Katane, helping to capture the city and absorbing half of its territory. By 453/2 BC, he had not only 
united much of the Sicilian interior under his rule, but he had also founded an important new Sikel city, Palike, in the vicinity of Mt. Aitna. 
Douketios&apos; expansionist policies, however, began to cause alarm and uneasiness among the other city-states, chief among them Akragas and 
Syracuse, which allied against him in 451 BC, and it is possible that this coin was struck in order to pay for Messana&apos;s part in supporting that 
alliance. When Douketios subsequently took refuge in Syracuse, thereby precipitating a diplomatic conundrum for the Democracy, Syracuse 
cannily sent him to Corinth, their mother city. In 448/7 BC, however, Douketios escaped and returned to Sicily where he again rose to power, 
directing his attention to the northern part of the island. There he founded a city, Kale Akte, or &quot;Fair Promontory&quot;, made up of not only Sicel 
settlers, but also Corinthians. While expanding his power in the area, he died in 440 BC.

By the third century BC, the Punic goddess Tanit and the horse had become the standard types of Carthaginian coinage and remained so for 
the balance of the city&apos;s existence. Tanit was the primary deity of Carthage. A celestial divinity with some fertility aspects, she was the North 
African equivalent of Astarte. She is always depicted on the coinage wearing a wreath of grain which may have been borrowed from Demeter 
and Persephone as the Carthaginians assimilated the Sicilian culture into their own during the various Punic excursions to the island. The 
use of the horse on the reverse is usually considered part of the foundation myth of Carthage. According to Virgil&apos;s Aeneid, the Phoenician 
colonists who founded Carthage were told by Juno (or Tanit) to establish the new colony at the place where they discovered a horse&apos;s head in 
the ground. An alternate theory is that the obverse head is actually Demeter or Persephone, whose worship was introduced to Carthage in 396 
BC to make amends for the destruction of the goddesses&apos; temples outside Syracuse by the Carthaginian army. 

Carthage began issuing a gold coinage in the 4th century BC, apparently to finance the expansion of their trading empire into Sicily. The 
quality of the gold dropped over time, and by the late 4th century, the series was entirely of electrum. As most of the Carthaginian silver was 
struck at local mints in their occupied cities in Sicily, very little silver was issued at Carthage. However, a robust bronze coinage of multiple 
denominations was issued alongside the gold and electrum coinage, reflecting the flourishing local economy. The conflicts with the Greeks in 
Sicily continued into the 3rd century BC, at which time Carthage also became embroiled in conflict with the new power in the region, Rome. 
This conflict led to three major wars, which continued to put great pressure on the Carthaginian economy, and the degradation in the metal 
quality during the earlier wars continued into this period, with the golden-yellow of the electrum eventually turing into a near white-yellow. 
Silver denominations were also issued more often during this latter period, but also were degraded into a billon coinage. Ultimately, these 
issues came to an end with the destruction of Carthage at the hands of the Romans at the conclusion of the Third Punic War in 146 BC.

Until the fifth century BC, the important gold mines of Skapté-Hylé belonged to Thasos, when they were appropriated by Athens. With the 
collapse of the Athenian empire in the late fifth century, this district reverted to the control of the local people. Around 360 BC, Thasos, at the 
urging of Athens and backed by an Athenian fleet, mounted a successful offensive and recaptured the mines of Skapté-Hylé, refounding the 
Thasian city of Daton and renaming it Krenides. In the spring of 356 BC, the Thracian king Kersobleptes prepared to attack Krenides. Athens, 
involved in the Social War, could not provide help to the colonists of Krenides, so they appealed to Philip of Macedon, who had recently 
taken possession of Amphipolis, for help. Philip successfully repelled this attack, and recolonized Krenides under the name Philippi, which 
he strongly fortified and provided many new colonists. Krenides had produced one series of Attic gold staters, with the head of Herakles on 
the obverse and a tripod on the reverse. This first issue was very distinctive in that the paws of the lion&apos;s skin did not cover Herakles&apos; neck. 
As Philippi, the town continued the production of the staters in two series, the first without the paws covering the neck, the second, from 
which this coin is a part, with the lion&apos;s paws in the more conventional location, closed around the neck. Minted alongside of this stater were 
also silver tetradrachms of a weight standard conforming with the standard employed by the Chalkidian League, Akanthos, and Philip&apos;s royal 
coinage. Gold production at Philippi was short lived as this second series was suspended before the end of the 340s.

This beautiful gold stater belongs to the period following the death of Alexander the Great when his half-brother, Philip III Arrhidaios, was 
the nominal head of state together with the conqueror&apos;s infant son by Roxane, Alexander IV. The gem-like delicacy of the engraving of these 
extraordinary dies singles this issue out as belonging to one of the mints of the Ionian coastal region of western Asia Minor, an area which, of 
course, was not controlled by the Macedonian monarchy in the time of Philip II. Kolophon is the city to which it is tentatively attributed, the 
tripod symbol linking it to an issue in the name of Philip III (cf. Price P41).

This intriguing coin is from an extremely rare issue comprising gold staters and silver tetradrachms struck at the mint of Lysimacheia within 
the few months between Lysimachos&apos; death at Korupedion in 281 BC and the city&apos;s autonomous period that began in 280 BC. During this 
time, the city was first under the control of Seleukos I and then his assassin, Ptolemy Keraunos, the eldest son of Ptolemy I of Egypt. While 
the elephant is undoubtedly one of the personal symbols of Seleukos, A. Houghton is certain that the issue is not an official Seleukid emission. 
Hollstein has argued convincingly that Keraunos was the issuer, using Lysimachos&apos; types because he styled himself the heir of Lysimachos. 
The elephant symbol is a reference to the war elephants held by Keraunos, who is reported to have supplied 50 of the beasts to Pyrrhos for his 
Italian expedition. An historically significant piece from the turbulent period of the Diadochs.

Founded in the fifth century BC, the Akarnanian Confederacy was composed from time to time of a varying number of the local towns. In 
438 BC, the Confederacy allied itself with Athens, providing it with support during the Peloponnesian War, while at the same time expanding 
its own control in the region. During this period, the Confederacy began to issue coinage, which, like the coins of many of the other Greek 
confederacies, were struck in the city-states of its leading members. The obverse of this federal coinage depicts the head of the river-god 
Achelöos, the eponymous patron of the river which formed the natural boundary between Akarnania and Aitolia. The reverse may depict 
Apollo Aktiakos, whose temple was located on the promontory overlooking the Gulf of Ambrakia and which may have served as the meeting 
place of the confederacy&apos;s members. 

During the fourth century BC, the Confederacy shifted its alliances between Sparta and Athens as they struggled to control Greece. By the 
latter part of the century, however, the Akarnanian Confederacy was allied with Macedon. In 314 BC, it sided with Kassander in the Diadoch 
Wars. Periodic border conflicts with the Aitolians resulted in the loss of Akarnanian border territories and, although an agreement was reached 
in 263/2 BC, by 250 BC, at about the same time this quarter stater was minted, the Akarnanian Confederacy was divided between the Aitolians 
and the Molossians in Epeiros. In 230 BC, the Akarnanian Confederacy enjoyed a brief revival, but after the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC, 
information about it disappears from the historical record.

S.D. Garland&apos;s study of this unique electrum coinage in NC 2013 does an excellent job challenging the long-standing interpretation of this 
coinage by B.V. Head, down dating it from circa 395 BC to 367-2 BC, and connecting it to the expansion of Boeotian hegemony in the years 
following the Battle of Leukra in 371 BC. His die study of the hemidrachm, though, requires a few notable corrections: (1) his reverse dies 4 
and 5 are actually the same; (2) the coin recorded by Imhoof-Blumer in 1877, 124, is actually struck from obverse die O2, not O3; and (3) his

During the War of the Diadochoi (315-311 BC), Antigonos I Monophthalmos sent his nephew Ptolemaios to Greece, where he formed an 
alliance with anti-Macedonian factions in various city-states. Ptolemaios was successful in uniting these factions into a single revolt against 
Kassander, and effectively wrested most of Greece from Macedonian control. His effort began in Boeotia and Euboia, where this issue was 
struck, likely to help finance the anti-Macedonian cause. The actions of Ptolemaios and his mercenaries succeeded in tying-up Kassander&apos;s 
forces during this war, and enabled Antigonos to focus his own efforts against the other Diadochoi allied against him.

On the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, his empire was divided up among the Diadochoi, or &quot;successors,&quot; who were the top generals 
in Alexander&apos;s army. With the aid of Antigonos I Monophthalmos, ruler of Phrygia, Kassander seized Macedon and most of Greece, including 
Athens (319-317 BC). Antigonos, however, had ambitions of his own. Planning to reunite Alexander&apos;s empire under his own leadership, he 
frightened the other Diadochoi, including Kassander, to join forces in the First Diadoch War (315-311 BC). Though he was slowed, Antigonos&apos; 
plans were not altogether thwarted. He continued in his attempts to reunite Alexander&apos;s empire under the title &apos;liberator of Greece.&apos; 

The Second Diadoch War broke out in 310 BC and lasted until 301 BC. During this war, in 307 BC, Antigonos&apos; son, Demetrios I Poliorketes, 
ousted Demetrios of Phaleron, Kassander&apos;s governor of Athens, and reestablished the old Athenian constitution. The grateful Athenians 
venerated Antigonos and Demetrios as divine saviors (theoi sōtēres). The freedom granted by the Athenian constitution, however, would 
prove to be a thorn in the side of Poliorketes. Soon, a demagogue by the name of Lachares came to power in the city and secretly allied 
himself to Kassander. Kassander pushed Lachares to increase his power, hoping to use the tyrant as a puppet through which he could exert 
his influence over Athens. Meanwhile, Demetrios lost favor with the Athenians as a result of various publicly financed extravagances and his 
sacrilegious installation of a harem in the Parthenon. Upon the death of Kassander in 298 or 297 BC, however, the Athenians were left in a 
vulnerable position. In 296 BC, Demetrios returned to Greece, temporarily blockading the city, until he was pulled away to deal with events in 
the Peloponnesos. Having secured his southern territory, Poliorketes again returned to besiege Athens in 295 BC. This siege lasted until early 
294 BC, when the Athenians, starving and isolated, surrendered. Upon the fall of Athens, Lachares fled to Thebes, taking with him as much 
treasure as he could carry. Demetrios soon caught up to the tyrant, conquering his city of refuge. Thereafter, until 279 BC, when mention of 
him is lost, Lachares seems to have run from city to city, desperately trying to flee his many enemies. 

This gold coin is thought to have been struck by Lachares during the siege in order to help finance the war effort (see Kroll, supra, pp. 251-4 
for a full analysis). The gold used to produce this issue, according to Pausanias (Description of Greece 1.XXV.7), was taken from the statue 
of Athena Parthenos, created during the massive Periklean building projects of the Thirty Years Peace. Such use of sacred gold would not 
be alien to the Athenians, who had previously used the gold from the statue during the Peloponnesian War (Thucydides, The History of the 
Peloponnesian War, ii.13). Perikles himself commissioned the sculptor Pheidias to craft the colossal chryselephantine statue. Today, the 
sculpture survives in a few small-scale copied votive sculptures, as well as on bronze coins of Lysimachos of Thrace and Athenian bronzes of 
the third century BC. In addition, a reproduction of the statue stands in the replica of the Parthenon in Centennial Park, Nashville. 

A story is told of Lachares by Polyaenos (Stratagems 3.7). As Lachares was fleeing Athens, he was pursued by a squadron of Tarentine cavalry. 
To distract his pursuers, the tyrant scattered &quot;gold darics&quot; (τῶν δαρεικῶν) on the road. The Tarentines stopped to pick up the money, giving 
Lachares enough time to escape. It is very possible, if not likely, that Polyaenos is not referring to Persian darics, but rather, the gold coins 
minted by Lachares. The Persians had been expelled from Greece two hundred years previously, and the Persian Empire itself had fallen to 
Alexander nearly 50 years before the time of Lachares. Therefore, it is unlikely that Persian darics were in circulation in Greece at the time. 
Since the Athenians, however, did not regularly mint gold coins, it is possible that when Polyaenos is using the word for daric, he is using it 
simply to mean &quot;a gold coin,&quot; and that the story refers to these emergency gold coins minted by Lachares.

While the myth of Europa as one of Zeus&apos; numerous trysts is well-known and has been the subject of literature and art since at least the fifth 
century BC, certain portions of the entire episode received more attention than others. What occurred when Zeus brought Europa to Crete 
is one such part. According to the later authors Theophrastos (371-ca. 287 BC) and Pliny the Elder (AD 23-79), Zeus consummated his 
abduction of Europa in a plane-tree (ἡ πλάτανος), an event commemorated on a series of silver and bronze issues from the Cretan city of 
Gortyna, the site of that event. 

According to the traditional account, Europa was the daughter of Agenor, king of Tyre, the sister of Kadmos, the legendary founder of Corinth, 
and Kilix, for whom Cilicia was named, and was a descendant of Io, one of Zeus&apos; numerous other mortal female trysts. Europa, too, attracted 
the eye of Zeus, who, transforming himself into a white bull, seduced the young girl, carrying her across the Aegean Sea to the region of 
Gortyna on Crete, where she was made the first queen of Crete. Gortyna&apos;s special involvement in this myth -it was claimed the plane-tree was 
still extant centuries after the event -made its depiction on the civic coinage an important reminder of the city&apos;s role in Crete&apos;s early history.

The Coinage of Phanes 

2056.

arguably the finest in private hands. 
($30,000) 

Ex Classical Numismatic Group Inventory 922163. 

The celebrated coins of Phanes -the first coins on which a legend appears -are known to be among the earliest of Greek coins, as a hemihekte 
(twelfth stater) of the issue was found in the famous foundation deposit of the temple of Artemis at Ephesos. It is this find spot, along with 
the design of the grazing stag (an animal associated with Artemis and which was used on later Ephesian issues), that has suggested Ephesos 
as the mint. 

The Phanes coinage consists of seven denominations, from stater down to 1/96 stater, with some denominations occurring in different varieties 
(the stag facing in different directions and sometimes associated with the symbol of a pentagram or a triad of pellets). Only the two largest 
denominations bear the name of Phanes. The approximately four known staters carry the legend ΦΑΝΕΟΣ ΕΜΙ ΣΗΜΑ (or similar) (&quot;I 
am the badge of Phanes&quot;), and the trites (third staters) bear just the name ΦΑΝΕΟΣ (&quot;of Phanes&quot;). The Phanes who issued these coins is 
otherwise unattested. The use of a personal name at this early point in the development of coinage is instructive. We know from these coins 
that the responsibility for the issue was personal -whether the issuer was an official or a private individual -rather than collective, i.e. the 
citizenry as a whole.

The gold coinage of Pixodaros, struck in multiple denominations on the Persian standard, is the sole coinage struck in that metal by any of 
the Carian satraps. The hemistaters are the largest denomination of this coinage and are particularly rare compared to the smaller fractions. It 
is unknown whether a specific event prompted the introduction of the gold issues, but Konuk (supra) proposes that it may have been due to a 
shortage of silver, a situation that began under Pixodarus&apos; predecessor, Hidrieus. The use of gold in the economy at that time would not pose 
much difficulty, as a twelfth stater would equate to a silver didrachm.

Ex Triton VII (13 January 2004), lot 335. 

Evagoras II, the namesake of his illustrious grandfather Evagoras I, succeeded his father Nikokles upon the latter&apos;s assassination in 361 BC. 
Evagoras reigned for ten years but was expelled by his subjects in 351 BC after refusing to support a revolt against the Persians. He found 
refuge in Caria and was appointed satrap by the Persian king Artaxerxes III. In 350 BC, under instructions from Artaxerxes, the Carian satrap 
Hidrieus and Evagoras invaded Cyprus to reinstall Evagoras as King. The expedition failed and Artaxerxes then appointed Evagoras as king 
of Sidon. He apparently abused this appointment and was forced to flee to Cyprus, where he was captured and executed circa 346 BC. 

E. Markou, in her book on the gold coinage of Cyprus, condemned this coin based on the iconography of the reverse. However, that 
determination was predicated on the assumption that the figure represented Herakles, which it clearly does not. In private correspondence 
with Markou, she agreed that the type more likely represented Artemis or Apollo, but still rejects this iconography on a Cypriot coin. In our 
opinion, the coin is clearly of ancient manufacture, and genuine in all respects. The appearance of this iconography, too, is unexceptional; 
though it may be unique to coinage on Cyprus, the depiction of Artemis or Apollo shooting a bow is well known on other coinage of the Greek 
world (see, e.g., at Abdera [cf. May 458], Ambrakeia [cf. BMC 20], Corinth [cf. Pegasi 454], Eleuthernai [cf. Svoronos 1], Larissa [cf. Rogers 
307 and BCD 1174], and Syracuse [cf. HGC 2, 1412]). Moreover, the portrait of both Artemis and Apollo is known on other coins of Cyprus. 
In sum, it is our opinion that the type is not dispositive of the authenticity of the piece, and it has all the characteristics of an ancient coin.

Ex Leu 77 (11 May 2000), lot 363; Victor Adda Collection. 

Pnytagoras came to power following the deposition of his half-uncle Evagoras II, who was expelled by his subjects after refusing to support 
a revolt against the Persians. Following the revolt, the Persians mounted an invasion to retake Cyprus and supported Evagoras in his bid to 
regain his throne in Salamis. Soon, however, unknown accusations were made against Evagoras which prompted the Persians to change 
their support to Pnytagoras, who subsequently submitted to the Persian king. After the battle of Ipsos, Pnytagoras allied himself with the 
Macedonians, and his fleet participated in the important siege of Tyre in 332 BC. Following the siege, Alexander rewarded Pnytagoras with 
the city of Tamassos, which had been a possession of Kition. Pnytagoras died later that same year and was succeeded by his son, Nikokreon. 
Pnytagoras&apos; gold staters feature the bust of Cypriote Aphrodite, as celebrated by her numerous cult centers on the island. Her turreted crown 
on the obverse of this coin shows her assimilation to Tyche as the protecting civic goddess for the whole of Cyprus.

Nikokreon was the son of Pnytagoras, and continued using the same stater types as his father, simply replacing the name on the obverse. 
During the Diadoch Wars, Nikokreon allied himself to Ptolemy I against the Antigonids, for which the Egyptian ruler awarded him the title 
&quot;General of the Island of Cyprus&quot; in 312 BC. Nikokreon was the last of the Teucridai to rule in Salamis; upon his death in 310 BC, the city 
came under the rule of Ptolemy&apos;s brother, Menelaos.

Ex Triton X (9 January 2007), lot 412. 

This extraordinary gold issue, unknown until the discovery of two examples in the Mir Zakah II deposit, bears the familiar types used by 
Mazaios as satrap of Cilicia for his silver staters, but without the usual legend and monograms. Mazaios, a Persian nobleman, had a long and 
distinguished career. He was appointed satrap of Cilicia about 361 BC, and the region known as &apos;Across the River&apos; (modern Syria, Lebanon, 
and Israel) was later added to his domain. He fought against the Phoenicians of Sidon who revolted with the support of Pharaoh Nektanebo II 
and the Greek mercenary leader Mentor. Mazaios later served as the satrap of Mesopotamia and married Barsine, the daughter of Darios III. 
Mazaios&apos; absence from the first fighting when Alexander invaded Asia has been explained by the likelihood that he was the satrap of Babylonia 
at the time and was guarding Darios&apos; back. 

In 331 BC, as Alexander marched into the heart of the Persian Empire, Mazaios obstructed his way with a small cavalry contingent and forced 
Alexander to take a route leading to Gaugamela, where the massive Persian army had assembled in wait for Alexander on the Persians&apos; chosen 
battleground. In the battle itself, Mazaios and his Babylonian cavalry nearly broke Alexander&apos;s left wing, but the flight of the Persian king 
led to the collapse of the Persian army. Mazaios took refuge in Babylon. Alexander, upon his approach to the great metropolis, announced 
that Babylon would not be plundered, and Mazaios thereupon surrendered the city to him. Alexander rewarded Mazaios by retaining him as 
governor, a position he held until his death in 328 BC. 

Alexander made Babylon his royal seat, and there established one of his most important mints, where a large quantity of regular &apos;imperial&apos; 
coinage was struck, including the impressive dekadrachms. In addition to the imperial coinages, Babylon also produced a substantial group of 
local coinages, some of which initially bore the name of Mazaios, and it is among these Babylonian issues that the present type is to be placed. 

Mazaios instituted two principal local coinages in Babylon, silver &apos;lion staters&apos; and gold double darics (see H. Nicolet-Pierre, &quot;Argent et or 
frappés en Babylonie entre 331 et 311 ou de Mazdai a Séleucos,&quot; in Travaux de numismatique grecque offerts a Georges Le Rider, pp. 285-
305). For the &apos;lion staters&apos;, as for the present type, Mazaios adapted designs from a coinage that he had issued in his earlier days as satrap 
of Cilicia: the &apos;lion staters&apos; are modeled upon the &apos;Myriandros&apos; staters with types Baaltars / Lion (SNG Levante 185-188). In gold, Mazaios 
struck double darics modeled after the familiar darics of the pre-Alexander Persian world, with a figure (Persian king or hero) running right 
and holding a spear and bow. 

The types of the present coin identify the issuer as Mazaios, and the omission of a legend is characteristic of the Babylonian context. 
Achaemenid gold was routinely issued without legend, as were many of Mazaios&apos; standard double darics (MIG Type 14 = BMC Persia XX, 1). 
Although the early &apos;lion staters&apos; are normally struck in the name of Mazaios, some bore neither legend nor control mark (MIG Type 6 = BMC 
Persia XXI, 2). The present type is to be located alongside Mazaios&apos; other Babylonian coinages but it is clearly distinct from them. Perhaps it 
was an initial emergency issue that was later superseded, or perhaps it was a local variation for a special purpose. 

The two double darics from Mir Zakah II, among other coins in that hoard, have been condemned by some as forgeries, most notably by Silvia 
Hurter in her SNR 85 review article (pp. 185-99). The condemnation of these, the two Miho coins, has focused particularly on their style (the 
epigraphic argument she makes is rebutted by the analysis above). It must be stressed that the style of those two coins is significantly different 
from that found on the present specimen, which has a style, particularly the reverse, that is very similar to the models found on the Tarsos 
issues of Mazaios.

One of the great (and very popular) rarities for ancient gold coinage collectors is the gold stater (or daric?) issued by the Egyptian Pharaoh 
Nektanebo II. The authors of the die study cited above could account for only 42 examples struck from 3 obverse and 3 reverse dies with 5 
die combinations. They also listed 5 examples from the Mit Rahineh hoard (IGCH 1658) that they could not examine for their die study. The 
attribution to Nektanebo II is not infallible, and is based primarily on circumstantial historical evidence and not the coins themselves, which 
do not bear any specific ethnic or monogram. 

Nekht-har-hebi, or Nektanebo II as he was known to the Greeks, was the nephew of the Pharaoh Tachos (Djedhor). Placed in command of the 
Egyptian army in Syria during the Satrapal Revolt, he turned his troops against his own king, and uncle, and took Egypt by force. In 351-350 
BC, he repelled a Persian invasion but was driven from his throne in 344-343 by a second assault. He then fled Egypt and found refuge in 
Ethiopia and retained control of Upper Egypt for another few years. 

Nektanebo most likely would have issued his gold staters to pay the mercenaries in his army. What makes the coinage of Nektanebo stand out, 
though, is an Egyptian cultural revival for the coin&apos;s obverse and reverse types instead of imitating the Athenian tetradrachm types previously 
used in Egypt by the Greeks and Persians. As such, this is the only known coinage to employ a hieroglyph -a purely Egyptian coin.

In his die study of the early coinage of Ptolemy I, Zervos remarks that this issue is unique among the entire corpus of this king&apos;s coinage due 
to the lack of any legend or control marks. While he is certain that it was struck by Ptolemy I (W.H. Waddington thought these were non-
Ptolemaic imitations), that it was contemporary to the Attic weight silver, and that the mint was likely Alexandreia, he was unable to place it 
into an historical context that would explain its iconography and purpose. Nonetheless, it is the rarest of all Ptolemy I&apos;s issues, with only five 
known today, from three obverse and four reverse dies.

Coinage in the Name of Arsinöe 

Arsinoë II, wife (and sister) of Ptolemy II, exerted a powerful influence on her younger mate, her experience in statecraft coming from her 
earlier marriage to Lysimachos of Thrace, and her subsequent involvement in the turbulent politics of the Successor kingdoms. After her 
death in 271 BC, her devoted husband deified her, and initiated a cult in her honor. The temple he intended to construct (plans cut short by 
his own death) in her name was to have an iron ceiling with a statue of Arsinoë, made entirely of lodestone, suspended in the air beneath it. 
That grandiose plan came to nothing, but the series of large value gold and silver coins struck in her name was a suitable memorial. As noted 
by Lorber, the letters behind her bust are die sequence numbers, though it is still not proven whether they note annual issues. Under Ptolemy 
II, these large gold coins served a variety of purposes. The early issues were struck during the time of the Second Syrian War, but while some 
probably were used toward war finance, Lorber noted that these issues were too large to be solely for that purpose. The later issues were 
marked by an early spike in production, to Lorber, the evidence is fairly convincing that these were primarily related to the resettlement of 
veterans following the Second Syrian War and the reclamation of land in the villages of the Fayum. The issues of Arsinoe gold came to an 
end soon after the accession of Ptolemy III, but later kings sporadically issued more of them, a phenomenon that lasted into the middle of the 
2nd century BC. These issues are characterized by a less refined style in type and epigraphy, and their late chronology is confirmed by finds, 
though the reason for their reissue is unknown.

Ex Battos Collection (Nomos 9, 21 October 2014), lot 197. 

From the Nomos sale: &quot;This coin is decidedly unexpected! The gold coinage of Kyrene has been very carefully studied, both by E.S.G. 
Robinson in the BMC and by L. Naville in his well known publication of 1951, and the idea that a completely unknown Kyrenaian stater 
should appear from an old collection is astounding. Not only that, the appearance of Apollo Kitharoidos as its reverse is a further novum since 
this aspect of the god was also previously unknown on the coinage of Kyrene. The type is very close to the well-known Apollo Barberini 
in the Glyptothek, which is thought to reflect the cult statue of Apollo from the Temple of Apollo Palatinus in Rome (though this statue was 
surely based on an earlier Greek prototype).&quot; We add that the magistrate Pheidonos is attested on contemporary silver didrachms, Traité III 
1894, as well as drachms, Naville 144.

This piece was reportedly found in the upper Rhône valley, but the types are clearly influenced by the staters of Alexander the Great, which 
did not serve as a prototype for the Celtic tribes of Gaul. It is more likely that the coin originated in Central Europe, or even the Hungarian 
plain, where gold coin types often were modeled on Alexander&apos;s coinage, and made its way west through trade.

the Rig Veda, Shaoreoro was the genius of Kushan imperial might and the god of the molten metal that was to cover the earth on the Last Day.

Pharo was associated with Khvareno, the Iranian personification of the glory and legitimacy of kings. His winged cap, associating him with 
Orlagno and his victories, may also associate this god with Hermes-Mercury, the god of treasure. As Hermes, his messages were carried on 
the wing, while the halo and lotus signify his passage between worlds. As Mercury, his purse indicated the profit resulting from a gloriously 
legitimate royal rule.

This issue has traditionally been attributed to a ruler named Prakasaditya, who has been placed with the Guptas. While the types have parallels 
to certain Gupta issues, the shape of the horseman&apos;s head and the type of headdress he wears have a clear affinity with issues of the Alkhon 
Huns. This had led to a debate among scholars, with a minority advocating that it was actually a Hunnic issue. Compounding the problem is 
the fact that the most accessible of these coins have been struck on compact flans, obscuring most of the letters of the name in the obverse 
legend. Recently, though, this debate came to a conclusion with Pankaj Tandon&apos;s discovery of a coin in a provincial museum in India with the 
full obverse legend visible. This coin clearly showed that the issuer was the Hunnic king Toramana, and the word Prakasaditya is an epithet 
for him.

This, the first gold coinage of the Roman Republic, was minted at a time of national crisis. In 218 BC, Hannibal, the Carthaginian leader in 
Spain, led his army across the Alps and invaded northern Italy, thus beginning the Second Punic War. The invader won a series of brilliant 
victories culminating in the battle of Cannae, in 216 BC, in which the Romans are said to have lost 70,000 men. Gold staters and half staters 
were struck at this time having as their obverse type a beardless janiform head perhaps representing the Dioscuri, the gods who gave special 
protection to the Romans on the field of battle. The attractive reverse type shows an oath-taking scene, the clear intention being to strengthen 
the resolve of Rome&apos;s allies in the face of Hannibal&apos;s intimidating presence.

ROMAN IMPERIAL COINAGE 

The Restored Coinage of Trajan 

According to Curtis Clay, the primary purpose of restored coins was to provide substitutes in circulation for coin types that had become familiar, 
but that the emperor was calling in, melting down, and restriking, because the originals were worn out and sometimes also because they 
contained more precious metal than current coins, so the emperor could make a profit. When selecting the types for the restored coins, however, 
a secondary purpose kicked in: to present a full picture of earlier Roman coinage, and to honor worthy earlier emperors, even if the earlier coins 
in question were not actually being called in and restruck, either because they were so old that they were no longer in circulation, or because 
they were so recent that they were still in excellent condition and contained no more bullion than the mint&apos;s current production. This secondary 
purpose explains Trajan&apos;s restoration of both a Republican didrachm, though such didrachms were certainly no longer in circulation, and of 
aurei of Nerva and Divus Nerva, though Nerva&apos;s aurei were only a decade old so didn&apos;t need restriking because of wear. It explains why Trajan 
Decius&apos; restored antoniniani included coins for Divus Augustus, whose original denarii had long since disappeared from circulation. And finally 
it explains why Titus&apos; restored bronzes included coins for Galba, whose original bronzes were also only a dozen years old. 

As Mattingly wrote regarding Titus&apos; selection of emperors for restoration: &quot;The list of persons whose coins were to be restored was evidently 
drawn up with deliberate care. Tiberius, Claudius, and Galba were included, Caligula, Nero, Otho, and Vitellius omitted. The list is something 
like a roll of honour of the early Empire, preserving all memories that deserved to be remembered&quot; (BMC II, p. lxxviii). 

Relative to dating Trajan&apos;s restored coins, the traditional dating of AD 107 is based on Eckhel&apos;s theory linking the restitution coinage with the 
general recoinage that Dio places after Trajan&apos;s return from the Second Dacian War. Bernhard Woytek disagrees, and places their issue in AD 
112/113, surmising that the appearance of Divus Nerva in this coinage must be contemporary to his appearance on an aureus securely dated 
to that period. Clay, however, pleads for the traditional dating of recoinage which, according to Dio, began circa AD 107. Curtis states that &quot;If 
the restored coinage was connected with the recoinage, and the recoinage began circa AD 107, how likely is it that Trajan would have waited 
until AD 112-3 to issue the restored coins resulting from that recoinage?&quot;

The siege of Vienna in 1529 was the first of two sieges by the Ottoman Turks against the city (the later coming in 1683). After a successful 
military campaign in Hungary, the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman I advanced on Vienna with an enormous force in the fall of 1529. However, due 
to poor weather and a strong defense of the city, he was soon forced to abandon the siege. This event was a highwater mark for the Turkish 
expansion. For more than a century afterward, the Ottoman Empire would not have the power to threaten central Europe.

Ferdinand ascended to the throne of Hungary and Bohemia at the tender age of nineteen. Though his reign here was characterized by a 
strengthening of the authority of the central government, the young ruler&apos;s greatest challenges came when he succeeded his father, Ferdinand 
II, as Holy Roman Emperor in 1637. By this point, the Empire had been mired in a conflict -later known as the Thirty Years&apos; War -that had 
ravaged the continent for nineteen years. Ferdinand sought peace, but in order to secure his German allies for the negotiations, he resorted to 
granting them the authority to determine their own foreign policy, an act which would greatly increase their autonomy and ultimately lead to 
the gradual dissolution of the Empire itself. The Peace of Westphalia finally ended the conflict in 1648.

Though the Dutch Republic already had a powerful trading empire in the east with the Dutch East Indies Company, they also coveted the 
resources originating in the New World, particularly the valuable sugar plantations of Brazil. To this end, the Dutch West Indies Company 
seized control of the Brazilian province of Pernambuco in 1630, establishing a colony with its capital in modern-day Recife. The conquest 
obviously did not sit well with the Portuguese, who continually fought to reclaim the territory. The short-lived Dutch colony met its end with 
the Portuguese capture of Recife in 1654.

Despite the numerous mints established to handle the flow of raw metals from the New World, vast quantities were still shipped to Europe in 
a raw or uncoined state. In late 18th and early 19th century Brazil, these shipments took the form of short, bar-shaped ingots, stamped with 
the producing furnace, the fineness, the assayer, and other information. These bars were accompanied by a guia, a short, one-page document 
detailing the information on the bar, as well as recording the various taxes paid. These certificates were usually lost, and the ingots themselves 
frequently melted down to be used in other forms. For a fascinating example of an ingot accompanied by its original guia, see Sedwick 10,

Ex Spink-Taisei 13 (3 September 1992), lot 39. 

Chinese coinage of the tumultuous Warring States Period took a number of forms. Spades and knives of various shapes and sizes, round coins 
with square or round holes, and &apos;ant nose&apos; bronzes were all seen in the market places. The State of Chǔ was home to one of the most interesting 
coin types in Chinese history -the Jin Yuan, a currency composed of small gold ingots stamped with a number of squares. These gold pieces 
were reported in historical and numismatic texts as early as AD 1050, but the characters were not correctly read until 1878, when they were 
finally assigned to Chǔ. 

The coins consist of a flat, cast piece of gold stamped multiple times with two characters contained in a square. Smaller &quot;denominations&quot; could 
have been procured by chopping up larger Jin Yuan. The smaller pieces do not appear to maintain any single weight standard, suggesting that 
they were weighed at each transaction.

struck in silver, of the same size weight as the dollar, and in gold, depicting the new president in both civilian and military dress. The gold 
examples were distributed to the senators. The dual typologyof this issue is indicative of Cáo&apos;s rise to power. A member of the Běiyáng Clique,

By late 1949, the People&apos;s Liberation Army had driven Nationalist forces into a near route. The Kuomintang realized that their fiat currency 
would be all but worthless under such disastrous circumstances and so apparently considered striking precious metal coinage to pay their 
troops. A series of extremely rare patterns were produced at Chéngdū, then the last city in Nationalist hands, from dies originally made to strike 
the 1940 coinage. The dies were altered to remove the denomination name and to change the date from year 29 to year 39. But the experiment 
came to naught, as Chéngdū fell to the Communists in December 1949, with the remaining Nationalist forces fleeing to Taiwan soon after.

Scholarly opinion is divided on the authenticity of this issue. E.G.V. Newman, having examined the present specimen in hand alongside 
the example held in the British Museum, initially determined it to be an authentic contemporary piece, noting that this coin features less die 
deterioration in the reverse &apos;IMP...&apos;. However, the late Sylvia Hurter asserted without elaboration that the coin was a later strike produced in 
the time of Napoléon III. Though Hurter declined to elaborate on her reasoning, Dr. Adams hypothesized that her doubts may have originated 
in the lower fineness of this example (.903 versus the usual .917) and the plain edge. Adams suggests that, as these were not regular circulating 
issues and were rather used at the royal gambling tables and for presentation purposes, they need not have been held to the same rigorous 
standards of fineness.

the Treaty of Utrecht, on the strength of its undertype. While this exact countermark is not known beyond the present example, two similar 
stamps with the letter JR and the key symbol -the emblem of Gibraltar -are known from examples in Garrett and the BM.

This coin is part of an issue struck in 1939 to commemorate the re-establishment of the kingdom. The order for their production, placed 
through Spink, was delivered after the Second World War had started, and the coins were never delivered to the Greek authorities. Spink put 
the coins up for sale with a special concession from the Greek Government (see Numismatic Circular, January 1941); the 100 drachmai were 
sold for £25. During the course of the war, Spink&apos;s offices were bombed and a number of these coins were lost. The original order placed by 
the Greek Government was for 140 pieces of the 100 Drachmai and 200 pieces of the 20 Drachmai.

Zodiac Mohurs 

Previously to this, the rule of the coinage was that on the face of the metal they stamped my name, and on the reverse the name of the place 
and the year of the reign. At this time it entered my mind that in place of the month they should substitute the figure of the constellation which 
belonged to that month...in each month that was struck, the figure of the constellation was to be on one face, as if the sun was emerging from it. 

The Memoirs of Jahangir [Tuzk-e Jahangiri] (Entry for 20 March 1619) 

In the 29th year of his reign, the Mughal emperor Akbar (1556-1605) established the Din-e Ilahi (literally faith of God), a syncretic belief 
system that incorporated elements of the different religious beliefs in his empire. Immediately thereafter, Akbar began counting his reign in 
accordance with the tenets of this new belief system. Known as the Ilahi Era, dating was now based on a solar, rather than lunar, calendar with 
the year divided into twelve Ilahi months. 

Akbar&apos;s early successors continued to employ this dating system. Jahangir (1605-1628), Akbar&apos;s son and immediate successor, used the Ilahi 
Era to great artistic effect by issuing two series of mohurs that incorporated Ilahi Era elements. The earliest series, known as the portrait series, 
since the coins show the emperor on the obverse, all show the constellation Leo superimposed over the sun -a reference to Jahangir&apos;s birth 
in August. This series was struck within a three-year span early in Jahangir&apos;s reign and are quite rare. The second series, known as the zodiac 
series, since each of the twelve constellations of the Zodiac is represented on the reverse, was a much larger series. Struck both in gold and 
silver, the zodiac series was issued from several mints (with Agra being the primary), and like the previous series, minted over three or four 
years. Since the Ilahi months were solar months and corresponded with the solar ecliptic (an imaginary line in the sky that marks the annual 
path of the sun), each month was represented by an appropriate sign of the Zodiac, recording its particular month of issue. 

Because many of these coins had been recalled and melted by Jahangir&apos;s successor, Shah Jahan, original strikes are very rare. Collector 
restrikes were periodically issued over the following century, and though they are more often encountered than the originals, are relatively 
rare themselves. Numismatists have divided the portrait and zodiac series mohurs into four classes: 

Class A: undisputed original strikes, characterized by deep relief, somewhat uneven flans, and rounded calligraphy. 
Class B: possibly original strikes, but more likely minted in the first decade or two following Jahangir&apos;s death. The relief is shallower, of a 
more uniform appearance, and the calligraphy is more square. 
Class C: mohurs of Class A or B that have had the zodiac type removed and re-engraved. 
Class D: later imitations and forgeries.

Ex Triton X (9 January 2007), lot 1233. 

Struck at Goa in the months of that town&apos;s first occupation by the Portuguese viceroy, Afonso de Albuquerque (January-August 1510), this 
extremely rare manoel (or cruzado) had been known only from a line drawing published in T. de Noronha &amp; A. de Toro, Numismatica Portugueza 
a Dicionario de Numismatica Portugueza (Porto: 1872-1884), and subsequently reproduced in modern catalogs on the subject. Although gold 
half manoels were known, the existence of this larger denomination had been a subject of scholarly speculation. However, a small hoard of gold 
coins discovered in the vicinity of Goa in October 2005 contained two specimens of this type. Our coin, a previously unknown specimen and not 
one of those reported from the hoard, represents the fourth known example. Although there is a great similarity in style between this coin and the 
one illustrated from the published report of the hoard, the lack of any die-link among these coins indicates that they were part of a large issue. 

By the middle of fifteenth century, Europe&apos;s access to the spices and the luxury goods from the East had been severely curtailed by the Turkish 
advance in the eastern Aegean and the continued loss of Byzantine territory and power. Consequently, the Silk Road, which for centuries had 
provided the conduit for such items, was effectively closed to the West Europeans. Spurred by the technological developments of the Renaissance, 
they sought alternative routes by which they could continue to acquire these luxury items. The first nation to begin exploring alternative routes was 
Portugal. Beginning with Prince Henry the Navigator, the Portuguese slowly began to embark on voyages charting the Atlantic coast of Africa, 
making detailed maps and incrementally establishing outposts from which explorations further south might occur. In 1488, when Bartholomeu 
Dias, a student of o Infante D. Henrique o Navegador (Prince Henry the Navigator), had rounded the southern tip of Africa, the Portuguese had 
discovered the possibility of a sea route to the East that would allow them to acquire spices, and other luxury goods directly from their sources. 

These explorations by the Portuguese served a three-fold purpose. By controlling the trade routes to East, the details of which were a closely 
guarded state secret, Portugal could acquire much-needed revenue. Portugal could also attain a significant advantage over its neighbor Spain, who, 
under the kings of Castile and Leon, had been contemplating the annexation of Portugal. Finally, the kings of Portugal, devout monarchs that they 
were, could begin diplomatic relations with the legendary Asian Christian monarch, Prester John, whereby an alliance to drive the Turks from the 
Mediterranean might be obtained. Consequently, Manoel I commanded Vasco da Gama in 1497 to complete the formation of a trade route from 
the tip of Africa to India. 

Rounding the Cape of Good Hope in December 1497, da Gama edged his way up the eastern coast of Africa, continuing his predecessors&apos; policies 
of establishing posts along the way. At Mombasa, he encountered hostility from the local population; instead he continued north to Malindi, a 
friendlier city and one that provided him with the aid of local Arabic cartographers and Indian traders. On 20 May 1498, he reached India, landing 
at the port of Calicut (mod. Kozhikode). Although da Gama met with initial resistance from local merchants and experienced difficult negotiations, 
a trading agreement between the Portuguese and the local ruler was reached. Between the time of da Gama&apos;s departure from India in 1499 and 
1502, Portuguese interests there suffered and required da Gama&apos;s return with a fleet of twenty warships. Laying siege to Calicut, in October 1502 
he compelled the local ruler to sign a revised treaty whereby, in addition to the great quantity of war booty he received, da Gama severely curtailed 
Muslim trading between India and East Africa. The following year, upon da Gama&apos;s return to Portugal, Manoel I established the Estado da Índia, 
or Province of India, and appointed Francisco de Almeida, a trusted advisor, as the province&apos;s first viceroy. As a result, Portugal dominated the 
Indian Ocean trade routes from which it developed its Asian economic empire. 

Among those who followed in da Gama&apos;s footsteps was Afonso de Albuquerque. A military adventurer with significant ties to the Portuguese 
crown, he had served in Africa before heading out in 1503 for India. There, he assisted the viceroy Almeida in supporting the rule of the Kochi 
king, Unni Ramman Koyil. In return for their services, the new king granted the Portuguese the privilege of constructing a fort there. As a result, 
Kochi became the residence of the Portuguese viceroy. For the next seven years, Albuquerque fought in the Western Indian Ocean. He soon, 
however, ran afoul of Almeida, especially when royal letters arrived recognizing Albuquerque as the new viceroy. Almeida imprisoned his rival 
and only upon the arrival of the grand-marshal of Portugal in November 1509, was Albuquerque released and installed as the new viceroy, a 
position he held until his death in 1515. 

Upon his installation as viceroy, Albuquerque set out on an aggressive policy of consolidating Portuguese control of the Western Indian trade 
routes and undercutting the Muslim presence there. In January 1510, he unsuccessfully attacked Calicut, receiving a severe wound. Immediately 
thereafter, he besieged and captured Goa, a town that until then had been under the control of the Sultans of Delhi. From January to August, the 
Portuguese contolled the town, when our coin was struck. Unable to hold it for long, Albuquerque abandoned Goa in August. In November, 
however, he returned with reinforcements and recaptured it. As a result, the Portuguese now had a permanent colony under their control and a 
naval base from which they could conduct future regional operations.

Though there are no references to any gold tampangs, J. van der Chijs (Catalogus der numismatische verzameling van het Bataviaasch 
Genootschap van kunsten en wetenschappen. Batavia. 1896, p. 152) does note two silver tampangs, to which he gives a contemporary value 
of two reales and one real, respectively. Saran Singh also notes these same two pieces, speculating that they were private presentation pieces 
for the royal family, but can find no examples to confirm. In any case, it is extremely doubtful that these rare precious metal issues played any 
regular role in the currency system.

While the Germans occupied the Netherlands during World War Two, the United States mints produced coinage for the free Dutch territories, 
including for the East Indies. Silver issues were struck at Philadelphia, Denver, and San Francisco bearing a palm tree or acorn, as well as 
the P, D, and S mintmarks, respectively. However, a small number of rare off-metal strikes are known in gold, such as this and the following 
lot, bearing dates of the American-produced coinage, but lacking the correct mintmarks. One must note that the American mints were tightly 
controlled and would not have produced such collectors pieces, especially in gold, whereas the Dutch mint frequently struck them. Accordingly, 
it seems that these issues were struck in Utrecht some time after the Netherlands were liberated and the unused dies returned to the Dutch.

Insurgents in the Oaxaca region, led by General José María Morelos, were responsible for one of the most common and poorly studied 
coinages of the War of Independence. Though they initially attempted to strike silver coinage, the insurgents, cut off from from the established 
coining facilities and supplies of silver, soon resorted to casting and striking their money in bronze. Silver issues are generally scarce from this 
series. Gold coins, such as those here, are extremely rare and the subject of some scholarly suspicion. 

Pradeau suggests that at least some of these rare gold pieces are authentic. In support of this claim, he notes two citations to gold coinage that 
appear in contemporary literature. In one, an example of the new gold and silver pieces were sent to a female sympathizer and secret agent in 
Mexico City. In the other, royalist forces uncovered a cache containing not only silver pieces, but also twenty-nine gold pieces, mostly one 
reales. With regards to lot ____, Pradeau states that the coin is &quot;undoubtedly genuine&quot; (p. 110, note 1). 

Yet, for gold coinage to appear in an area that is starved even of silver is quite unexpected and strongly suggestive of a modern fantasy. 
Grove states that the 8 Reales were made for collectors. Likewise, NGC errs on the side of caution, and gives these two pieces a grade of 
&quot;questionable authenticity.&quot; The coins are offered here with both arguments presented, so that the bidder may decide for himself.

The Zappas Oympics (Greek Ζάππειες Ολυμπιάδες), known simply as the Olympics (Ολύμπια), was a series of athletic events held at 
Athens, the purpose of which was to reintroduce a modern version of the ancient games into the nation of Greece. Sponsored by Evangelis 
Zappas (1800-1865), a Greek patriot, businessman, and philanthropist, who was inspired by the Greek nineteenth-century romantic, Panagiotis 
Soutsos. The first of these games were held in 1859 while Zappas was still living, while the other three -1870, 1875, and 1888 -were held 
posthumously in his honor. The contribution of Zappas to these games was critical: not only was it at his initiative that the Games were hosted 
in Greece, but he also provided the funds for staging them and creating the infrastructure for their operation. This included the construction of 
the Panathenaic Stadium (Παναθηναϊκό στάδιο), which was essentially a modern reconstruction that incorporated the remains of the ancient 
version. This location would serve as the site of the Games of the I Olympiad in 1896, as well as the Games of the XXVIII Olympiad in 2004. 

Like the 1850 Wenlock Olympian Games, founded by Dr. William Penny Brookes in England, the Zappas Olympics was not an international 
event. Like its British counterpart, however, the Zappas Olympics laid the foundations of the current modern version. In addition to including 
many of the ancient sports in the modern competitions, victors in 1859 were awarded with wreaths, as well as cash prizes and gold, silver, 
and bronze medals presented by George I, the King of the Hellenes. In 1870 and again in 1875, these gold, silver, and bronze medals were 
produced and distributed. In 1870, only the gold medals were marked with their respective classes, divided between Class A (first prize) or 
Class B (second prize); the silver and bronze versions were unmarked. In 1875, although the Class B gold medal was still struck, the 1870 
arrangement of medals was modified now to include the silver medal being marked Class B as well, establishing it as the second prize. The 
bronze remained unmarked, but the arrangement of gold, silver, and bronze medals as awards for first, second, and third prizes respectively, 
was established according to the original plan of the Zappas Olympics, and became the origin of the modern Gold, Silver, and Bronze awards 
issued for the modern Olympic Games.
