AUCTION TERMS 

All written, fax, email and phone bids must be received by 5PM (ET) May 17, 2016. 

The Electronic Close starts at 10AM ET on May 18, 2016. Lots close every 20 seconds. 

To participate in this sale electronically you must be registered and approved to bid on www.cngcoins.com. 

Please read the auction terms for new information regarding bidding, buyer&apos;s fees, and payment of invoices. 

This is an internet and mail bid sale with an automated electronic close, con-
ducted by Classical Numismatic Group, Inc. (CNG). Bidding in the auction 
constitutes acceptance of the following terms: 

1. 
The property listed in this catalogue is offered for sale by CNG for itself 
and as agent for various owners and other consignors. We reserve the right 
to reject any bid, to determine the opening price, to set bidding increments, 
to vary the order of the auction, to reopen bidding in the case of a dispute, to 
withdraw any lot, to bid on behalf of CNG, to bid on behalf of the consignor, 
and to permit the consignor to bid on his own lots. CNG may loan or advance 
money to consignors or prospective bidders, and may have an interest other 
than commission charges in any lot. CNG may bid on its own account as an 
&quot;insider&quot; with information not available to the public. 

2. 
Lots will be sold in the order listed in the catalogue. The first lot will 
close electronically at www.cngcoins.com at 9AM Eastern Time on the sale 
date, with subsequent lots closing every 20 seconds thereafter. All written, 
fax, email and phone bids must be received by 5PM Eastern Time, on the day 
prior to the sale date. Electronic bids may be placed by approved bidders up 
until the closing time of each lot. The electronic clock on the website represents 
the official closing time for each lot. Bidders intending to bid electronically 
must first register at www.cngcoins.com. New website registrations are pro-
cessed for approval Monday through Friday 9AM-5PM Eastern Time only. No 
new registrations will be approved on the sale date. 

3. 
A 21% Buyer&apos;s Fee will be added to the hammer price of all successful 
written, fax, email and phone bids. A 19% Buyer&apos;s Fee will be added to the 
hammer price of all successful electronic bids directly placed on www.cng-
coins.com. 

4. 
All coins are guaranteed genuine. Attribution, date, condition and other 
descriptions are the opinion of the cataloguer, and no warranty is expressed 
or implied. Please note that an auction sale is not an approval sale. Lots 
examined prior to the sale and lots purchased by floor bidders (including bid-
ders executing commission bids on behalf of other parties) may not be returned 
for any reason except lack of authenticity. All claims of misdescription and all 
claims of return, except claims regarding authenticity, must be made within 5 
days of receipt of material. Any claim of lack of authenticity must be made 
in writing by the original purchaser immediately after discovery that an item 
is not authentic, and upon making such a claim the original purchaser must 
immediately return the lot to CNG in the same condition as at the time of the 
auction. Coins that have been encapsulated (&quot;slabbed&quot;) by a grading and/or 
authentication service may not be returned for any reason, including authen-
ticity, if they have been removed from the encapsulation (&quot;slab&quot;). If payment 
is made by credit card, rights of return are governed by these Auction Terms 
which supercede any rights of return promulgated by the card issuer. Estimates 
are intended as a guide only and not as a statement of opinion of value. 

5. 
Invoices are due and payable immediately upon receipt. Interest and late 
fees of 2.0% per month, or at the highest rate permitted by law, whichever 
is less, from the date of the auction, shall be payable on invoices not settled 
within 30 days of the auction date. Payment may be made by check or bank 
wire. Credit cards (Visa or MasterCard) will be accepted; credit card payments 
will not be accepted more than 14 days after the sale date. Payment by check 
must be made in either US dollars ($) drawn on a US bank or British sterling 
(£) drawn on a British bank. All successful bidders outside North America and 
the United Kingdom will be charged an additional $20 fee for bank charges 
that are the result of international wire transfer fees; this fee will be deducted 
for credit card or check payment as described above. CNG may reduce or 
compromise any charge or fee at its discretion. 

6. 
Bidders not known to us must provide satisfactory credit references or 
pay a deposit as determined at CNG&apos;s discretion before bidding. Minors are 
not permitted to bid without written consent of a parent guaranteeing payment. 
CNG may require payment in full from any bidder prior to delivery of lots. 
Title does not pass until lots are paid in full. Upon receipt of lots, the buyer 
assumes full responsibility for loss or damage. Delivery to the buyer&apos;s address 
of record shall constitute receipt by the buyer regardless of the identity of the 
person accepting delivery. 

7. Estimates are in U.S. dollars ($) and bids must be made in even dollar 
($) amounts. The CNG website, www.cngcoins.com, will execute electronic 
bids on behalf of all electronic bidders. Subject to reserves and opening prices, 
all electronic bids will be executed by the electronic software at one bidding 
increment (approximately 10%) over the next highest bid. All written, fax, 
email and phone bids received before 5PM the day prior to the sale date will be 
uploaded to the CNG website no later than the day prior to the sale date. These 
bids will not be subject to the minimum required bid cited on the website at 
the time of the upload. Any written, fax, email and phone bids received after 
the deadline or with special instructions will be executed at CNG&apos;s complete 
discretion and will be subject to the next bid required by the website. In the 
case of identical written, fax, email and phone bids, the earliest bid received 
wins. An electronic bid has priority over any identical written, fax, email or 
phone bid. Bid by lot number. No lot will be broken. Bidders are responsible 
for errors in bidding. Check your bids carefully. Electronic bidders may check 
their bids under User Services at www.cngcoins.com. 

8. A word on Reserves. CNG may place a reserve on any lot. However, no 
reserve will be higher than the estimate, and ordinarily lots are reserved at 60% 
of estimate. 

9. Bidders personally guarantee payment for their successful bids, including 
bidders executing commission bids from other parties and bidders representing 
corporations or other entities. Buyers accepting commission bids from other 
parties do so at their own risk and remain responsible for payment under these 
Auction Terms. 

10. In the event a successful bidder fails to make full payment within 30 
days of the auction date, CNG reserves the right to deem the sale incomplete 
and to resell the material, and the bidder agrees to pay for the reasonable cost 
of such a sale and also to pay any difference between the resale price and the 
previously successful bid. CNG reserves all rights that it is entitled to under 
the Pennsylvania Uniform Commercial Code, including the right to offset any 
sums due from a successful bidder against any future consignment or purchase 
or monies or goods in possession of CNG. 

11. Sales tax, postage, handling and insurance are the responsibility of the 
buyer and are added to all invoices where appropriate. For buyers in the 
European Union, CNG may import lots into the United Kingdom prior to 
shipment and charge buyers the import Value Added Tax. On any tax not paid 
by the purchaser which should have been paid, even if not invoiced by CNG, 
the purchaser agrees to pay the same on demand together with any interest or 
penalty that may be assessed. It is the responsibility of the buyer to comply 
with foreign customs and other regulations. 

12. Prices realized are published and are mailed with CNG&apos;s next publica-
tion. Prices realized are posted at www.cngcoins.com and successful electronic 
bidders are notified by email after the last lot of the sale closes. 

13. Bidders hereby waive any claim for incidental, consequential or exem-
plary damages arising from this auction. The sole remedy that any participant 
in the auction shall have for any claim or controversy arising out of the auction 
shall be a refund, without interest, of all or part of the purchase price paid by 
the participant. 

14. All rights granted by CNG or otherwise available to bidders and pur-
chasers, under these Auction Terms or otherwise, are personal and may not 
be assigned or transferred to any other person or entity, whether by operation 
of law or otherwise. No third party may rely on any benefit or right conferred 
by these Auction Terms. Bidders acting as agents must disclose the agency in 
writing to CNG prior to the auction; otherwise rights are limited to the agent 
and are not transferable to the undisclosed principal. 

15. Any dispute regarding this auction shall be governed by the laws of 
Pennsylvania and shall be adjudicated only by the Lancaster County Court 
of Common Pleas or the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of 
Pennsylvania; all bidders submit themselves to the personal jurisdiction of 
these courts for this purpose, consent to service of process by registered or 
certified mail, and waive any contrary provisions of Articles 14 or 15 of the 
French Civil Code and any similar provisions in any jurisdiction. All bidders 
consent to the confidentiality of consignors&apos; identities and waive any right to 
require disclosure of the name of the consignor or owner of any auction lot, 
whether such right is based on New York GOL  §5-701(a) or any other provi-
sion in any jurisdiction. In any dispute regarding this auction, the prevailing 
party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorney fees. </preface>

Thomas Bentley Cederlind 
1959-2015 

Thomas Bentley Cederlind died unexpectedly 
on 16 December 2015 in his hometown 
of Portland, Oregon. Born in Bellingham, 
Washington on 9 August 1959 to Dr. &amp; Mrs. 
Irvin Cederlind, Tom was the youngest of four 
brothers. After graduating from Sehome High 
School in Bellingham in 1977, he studied 
ancient history at Lewis and Clark College 
in Portland and, after some time off, then 
transferred to Pomona College in California, 
where he received his Bachelor&apos;s degree in 
1986, graduating magna cum laude. 

Even before obtaining his degree, Tom was 
already an established dealer in ancient coins 
and antiquities. During his more than 30 active 
years in the coin trade, he published 181 
catalogs, the last one scheduled to close on the 
day of his death. Considered by his clients as &quot;a gentleman who favored a good conversation over a big turnover,&quot; the well-
known collector BCD described him with the following words first published by Uschi Kampmann (CoinsWeekly) in a tribute 
to Tom on 7 January 2016 that probably describes Tom&apos;s attitude toward his profession best: 

&quot;Tom is no longer with us. I will miss the enigmatic half-smile he had in store for me every time I visited his table 
during the December (and later, January) New York show, going back so many years that memories fade like wisps 
of smoke. I am sure that from somewhere above, his spirit is looking down upon us, contemplating with the same 
half-smile, the big joke that the lives of each one of us were, are, and will be. 

I will not say anything about his passion for coins, which has been an integral part of his life. All of us involved with 
this great hobby, but mostly his family that had to live with his wonderful obsession, knew about it, and respected 
him for it. 

I will not talk about his quiet, unassuming disposition when it came to talking about coins with collectors who asked 
from him so much more than they could ever give back. He was always willing to help with information and advice, 
even when he knew that he would get nothing in return. 

I will not mention his integrity and fairness in his dealings, as it would be stating the obvious to all who ever 
conducted business with him. 

But I have one story that I would like to share with you. It involves repeated desperate phone calls between Athens, 
Greece and Portland, Oregon during very inconvenient hours. I was asking (actually pleading with) Tom to try and 
recover a coin from his list that was sold to another collector. Those were the days before electronic mailing and the 
list arrived, as usual, too late. The coin was not only unique, but also from a totally unknown mint. Tom immediately 
understood how important it was for me, and he was able to get it back by paying a small premium to the collector. 
He wanted no commission for his efforts, and this alone speaks for the man&apos;s quality. 

It is rare for a dealer to &apos;get into the skin&apos; of a collector and &apos;feel&apos; with him, live through his highs and lows, his 
cravings, his disappointments, and his triumphs. Tom was such a person and that is why we all loved being with him, 
and we now miss him and will keep missing him for a long, long time to come.&quot; 

Another testimonial about Tom comes from his long-time associate and employee, Michael Bezayiff: 

&quot;Tom was a highly intelligent man, who was very generous with sharing his knowledge with both his colleagues 
and collectors. On more than one occasion, I witnessed him leave the table in order to walk a new collector over 
and look at numismatic books. He was making sure they were introduced to what they may need to appreciate this 
hobby. While this act was not completely selfless, it did at times help the entire coin collecting community. That is 
the way he was, always teaching and sharing this part of himself.&quot; 

Tom Cederlind is survived by his three-year-old son, Leif Spenser Broncova Cederlind, and by two of his brothers, Jim 
Cederlind of Seattle, and Dr. Gary Cederlind (wife Cathy; children Ben and Tara) of Sacramento, CA. It should be noted that 
all of the net proceeds from the sale of Tom&apos;s inventory will be going into a trust fund to benefit his son, as per Tom&apos;s wishes.

J. Eric Engstrom is an attorney from Wichita, Kansas. 
Graduating from the University of Chicago Law 
School, he began his practice in New York City with 
Dewey Ballantine and then returned to his hometown 
after his military service. Collecting coins for some 
65 years, he started with a bag of coins an uncle 
brought back from World War II. He earned money 
to buy his first ancient coins by mowing lawns, 
and his first ancient coin was a Constantine bronze 
advertised in Boy&apos;s Life magazine for fifty cents. 
Soon after, he bought his first denarius-of Trajan-
from B. Max Mehl for $1.50. Engstrom&apos;s collecting 
of ancient coins culminated in the acquisition of a 
Syracusan dekadrachm. 

While still an undergraduate student at Dartmouth College, Engstrom authored the book, Coins in Shakespeare, a Numismatic 
Guide, with the help of Doran Jones. While at Balliol College, University of Oxford, he studied at the Heberden Coin Room, 
Ashmolean Museum, under Dr. Colin Kraay and other members of that remarkable staff. While serving as an Army Captain 
in Vietnam, he finished work on his second book, The Medallic Portraits of Sir Winston Churchill. He has attended two 
international numismatic conferences, and has met many well-known scholars, collectors, and dealers over the years. 

In 1975, he was appointed by President Ford to the United States Assay Commission for that year. He co-chaired the committee 
designing the Kansas Statehood Commemorative Quarter. In addition to his two published books on numismatics, he has 
written articles and reviews for several publications. He is a Life Fellow of the American Numismatic Society, a Fellow of the 
Royal Numismatic Society, and a member of the American Numismatic Association for over 58 years. 

Outside of his numismatic interests, Engstrom has been President and Chair of the Kansas Historical Foundation and the 
Wichita Sedgwick County Historical Museum. He is an Advisor Emeritus for the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and 
has been a member of the Kansas Historic Sites Board of Review for over 33 years, much of the time as Chair and Governor&apos;s 
Designee. He served as Interim Director of the Wichita Art Museum and has been President and Chair of its Board. Engstrom 
has a Master&apos;s Degree in European History from, and has served on the Board of Trustees of, Wichita State University. 

CNG would like to dedicate this auction catalog to one of our 
long-time employees, Dawn Ahlgren, who is retiring at the 
end of May after 26 years of service to the firm. Dawn started 
with CNG in June of 1990 at the firm&apos;s original location in 
Quarryville, Pennsylvania, and has been the backbone of the 
shipping department since. 

Dawn is looking forward to her retirement, and spending more 
time with her family, including her two granddaughters-Katie 
and Addie. More than likely, Dawn will also be frequenting the 
beach at Ocean City, Maryland, her favorite relaxation and 
vacation spot. 

Good luck Dawn and we&apos;ll miss you! </preface>

In his die study of the silver coinage of Velia, Williams was fairly certain of the attribution of the drachms of this type to that mint. However, he 
was skeptical regarding the attribution of diobols and obols, which he considered as &quot;Auriol&quot; types. Nonetheless, Rutter (in HN) considered 
that some fractions were from Velia. A comparison of the present piece (and the Ashmolean coins cited by Rutter) with those listed by 
Fürtwangler in his study of Auriol (Types Ua and Uc) shows a clear difference in style. The lion here is more severe (akin to the issues of 
Akanthos) than those of Auriol, but, perhaps more importantly, the incuse is quartered by thin lines, like those of Williams&apos; drachms, rather 
than being of a mill-sail-like design, like those of Auriol. Thus, the attribution of this obol to Velia rather than Massalia is more likely.

This issue of coinage corresponds to quite an eventful period in the history of Rhegion. Around 415/0 BC, the reverse type on the tetradrachms 
changed from a seated figure to the head of Apollo. It is thought that this significant change was precipitated by a change in regime in the 
city. In the mid 5th century, Rhegion was a steadfast supporter of Athenian interests in Magna Graecia, especially in 427 BC, when Rhegion 
provided its port as a base from which Athens could operate. By the time of the Athenian Expedition in 415 BC, however, Rhegion refused 
to participate, and remained neutral, an act that effectively blocked Athens&apos; access to the straits. The timing of the beginning of this issue 
roughly coincides with this event. Region&apos;s ambivalence towards Athens, though, did not translate into support for the interests of Syracuse. 
Perhaps wishing to distance itself from the turmoil in Sicily, Rhegion allied itself with the other major cities of southern Italy in a coalition 
against Dionysios I, the tyrant of Syracuse. Unfortunately, this decision proved disastrous, as Dionysios invaded Bruttium, and fought against 
the cities from 399-386 BC, with the result that Rhegion was reduced to near non-existence until it was refounded by Dionysios II in 360 BC. 
It seems likely that the bountiful tetradrachm coinage struck during this period was used to finance military activity. In any event, these coins 
exemplify the high aesthetic standard of the Classical Period that is common to the coins of Magna Graecia at this time. The facing lion head 
is rendered in a bold, detailed manner, as is the head of Apollo, carefully depicted as a serene deity. What separates these coins from their 
contemporaries is the depth of the relief, which was extraordinarily high. The effect is particularly striking on the obverse, where the lion head 
has an unsurpassed exceptional three-dimensional quality.

One of the earliest of the recognized masters of Sicilian engraving, the unknown artist who created the Demareteion dekadrachm of Syracuse 
was also responsible for several dies at the neighboring city of Leontini. R. Ross Holloway discusses the relationship of the Leontini 
tetradrachms with the masterworks of the &quot;Demareteion Master&quot; at Syracuse in &quot;Damarete&apos;s Lion,&quot; ANSMN XI, pp. 1-11. He regards them 
as works of the same hand, while Carmen Arnold-Biucchi, in her work on the Randazzo Hoard, sees influence from, but not the work of, the 
master, with the Leontini piece being a few years later and in a more developed realistic style. In any event, these tetradrachms of Leontini are 
among the finest works of Sicilian numismatic art.

Almost all examples from this obverse die have an olive spray behind the neck of Apollo. The cataloger of the ANS collection, seeing the 
clear tooling in Apollo&apos;s hair, rightly noted that their coin was tooled, but assumed that the olive spray was also removed in this process. The 
present coin, though, which is well struck in this area of the die, clearly shows that it was not originally present in the die, but rather a latter 
addition. Thus, the ANS coin may also be a rare example of this issue without the olive spray.

($1000) 

This die combination links Philistis&apos; two tetradrachm series, one with galloping quadriga reverse, the other with a slow quadriga. The link is 
doubly important as it suggests a reordering of the relative chronology of the slow quadriga series. In COO, the coins with a star control mark 
on the obverse were placed after three groups with different symbols, but the new link suggests the star group should be placed first (if the 
two series are consecutive).

Ingot Hoard (2002)&quot; in SNR 83 (2004), A corr. (not modern). VF, toned. Extremely rare. 
($15,000) 

The settlement of Borysthenes off the northern coast of the Black Sea is one of the earliest Greek settlements in the region of Skythia. Bronze 
arrowhead money is well attested from this site, but recently electrum staters and trites (Anokin 150 and 151) have been published that are 
thought to originate there, perhaps as a consequence of trade with the Greek cities of northwest Asia minor. 

In his article on the 2002 Ingot Hoard, Kim noted four struck coins that were included in the hoard, two staters of the present type and two 
trites as in the following lot. While generally skeptical of the hoard in general, Kim notes that the ingots could be of ancient manufacture, but 
based on their low gold content, the ingots must have been made not earlier than the 5th or 4th centuries BC. As for the coins, Kim concluded 
that these were likely modern forgeries, partially due to his skepticism over their general style and fabric, but mostly based on their metallurgy, 
which he thought should comport with the contemporary electrum at Kyzikos, Mytilene, and Phokaia, cities in the region that were still using 
electrum coinage as late as the 4th century BC. Recognizing that the coins were metallurgically compatible with the ingots, rather than the 
coins from these cities, he suggests that a modern forger probably made the coins from the ingots to increase the value of the hoard. 

We would propose a different interpretation. The differences in style and fabric that he noted are not dispositive; these coins are products of a 
mint that previously had only been known to produce bronze coins and proto-coinage, one that is also at a geographically significant distance 
from other mints producing electrum. Thus, these differences could easily be explained by the coins being a novel production at a mint not 
well versed in electrum production, and the types likely had a local context, one which is not readily apparent to us today. 

Kim&apos;s metallurgic reasons for doubting the coins is also not dispositive. We know that the metal content of electrum varied in different 
regions and over time. As noted above, the hoard is from a region that is geographically distant from the cities whose electrum coinage Kim 
compared it to. We also are uncertain of the date of the deposit of the hoard. Moreover, we know virtually nothing of the circulation pattern of 
any electrum coins issued from Borysthenes, such that a metrologic incompatibility with coins from Kyzikos, Mytilene, and Phokaia would 
not be unusual even if they were contemporary. It is therefore not unreasonable that the metal content of the electrum coins in this hoard are 
not an exact match with coins of a certain time frame from mints located in disparate regions around the Black Sea. 

In sum, there is very little that we know about the context of the hoard. These coins could even predate the trade of electrum coins across 
the Black Sea, and could have been intended for some other use where the types and metal content would not be inconsistent with normal 
commerce. Other than their novel appearance, there is very little to contradict accepting the coins as the product of an ancient mint. The fact 
that in the interim since Kim&apos;s article more of these coins have come to light, and they have been accepted as genuine by V. A. Anokhin, a 
scholar who is intimately knowledgeable with coins from this region, should give us confidence.

THRACE, Ainos. Circa 453/2-451/0 BC. AR Tetradrachm (25.5mm, 16.54 g, 9h). Antiadas, magistrate. Head of

Ex Künker 204 (12 March 2012), lot 196. 

As noted by May, the tetradrachms of his Group XVI are &quot;unique among the coinage of Ainos,&quot; in that the ethnic was moved from the 
reverse and placed on Hermes&apos; petasos, while the goat was framed by a linear square around which was placed the name of Antiadas and the 
figure of Pan. Both the placement of the ethnic on the obverse and the addition of a magistrate&apos;s name and symbol to the reverse is unlike 
all the other silver tetradrachms of Ainos, before and after, and these innovations were probably influenced by similar tetradrachms issued 
contemporaneously at the mints of Abdera and Maroneia. It is uncertain why these innovations were not continued in the subsequent series, 
but perhaps the answer lies in the lengthy pause between the end of the present series, circa 451/0 BC, and the beginning of the subsequent 
one, circa 435/4 BC. May&apos;s Group XVI coinage is also the only instance where a magistrate&apos;s name is found on the coins of Ainos, and this 
series is arguably the most intricate of all the profile bust tetradrachm series issued there in the early-mid 5th century.

The Bisaltai were a tribe of Pelasgian or Thracian origin and occupied the territory between the rivers Echedoros and Strymon, including 
the metalliferous mountains which separate the territory of the Bisaltai from the territory of the Krestonioi and Mygonia on the west (Hdt. 
7.115). At the time of the invasion of Xerxes in 480 BC, the Bisaltai were governed by a Thracian ruler who was independent of Macedonian 
influence, and refused to assist the Great King of Persia when his army crossed Thrace to invade mainland Greece. At some point after the 
Persian retreat, Alexander I of Macedon, who was in the service of Persians as early as 492 BC, annexed the territory as far as the Strymon 
Valley. Capturing its rich silver mines, he issued the first regal Macedonian coinage, which is indistinguishable from the Bisaltian but for the 
placing of his own name. The absence of Bisaltai oktadrachms in the Asyut hoard led Price and Waggoner to suggest a mintage date of circa 
475-465 BC. This coinage was terminated about the same time as the disaster at Drabeskos in 465/4 BC, in which the Athenian colonists of 
Ennea Hodoi (later Amphipolis) were exterminated by the native Thracians, though it is unknown whether this coinage is directly related to 
the Bisaltai&apos;s involvement in this conflict.

This beautiful gold stater belongs to the period following the death of Alexander the Great when his half-brother, Philip III Arrhidaios, was 
the nominal head of state together with the conqueror&apos;s infant son by Roxane, Alexander IV. The gem-like delicacy of the engraving of these 
extraordinary dies singles this issue out as belonging to one of the mints of the Ionian coastal region of western Asia Minor, an area which, of 
course, was not controlled by the Macedonian monarchy in the time of Philip II. Kolophon is the city to which it is tentatively attributed, the 
tripod symbol linking it to an issue in the name of Philip III (cf. Price P41).

The astragalos is only known for issues of Babylon and an uncertain mint (Price 4032). However, the style of the two known coins of this 
issue certainly discounts a relationship to either of those. In the prior sale of this coin, it was speculated that this is an issue of Selge in Pisidia, 
which commonly featured astragaloi on its coinage. However, Selge is not known to have issued any Alexander coinage, and for such an early 
issue as this coin, one cannot assume any symbol is a civic badge. In contrast, the style and fabric suggest this issue is from a mint in western 
Asia Minor; it is most similar to the obverse dies used on early posthumous Alexander tetradrachms from Miletos.

In his 1988 article on Rhodian imitations, R. Ashton has argued persuasively that this coinage was struck by Perseus to pay Cretan mercenaries 
serving in his army (see &quot;A Series of Pseudo-Rhodian Drachms from Mainland Greece,&quot; NC 1988, pp. 29-30). The Rhodian coinage circulated 
on Crete, where it was a familiar and trusted currency for the Cretans, and it is likely that they would have required payment in that form (see 
also R. Ashton, SM 146 [May 1987], p. 34).

From the estate of Thomas Bentley Cederlind. Ex Hebrew College Museum Collection (Gemini VII, 9 January 2011), lot 850. 

Although this coin was sold as a Samarian imitation in Gemini, the style of the piece is perfect for an official pi-style issue. Even the position 
of the ethnic, with the lower left bar of the A hidden by the neck of the owl, which Kroll notes is canonical for the series, is correct. The 
exceptional nature of the present coin is underscored by Kroll&apos;s assessment of the obols in his article (above): &quot;In the publications and several 
collections that I have consulted, I have found none with a clearly classifiable Pi I-V helmet ornament. [T]his results largely from the coins&apos; 
small size and imperfect die-cutting and preservation....&quot; In contrast to these remarks, this coin has a very good style, is well preserved, and 
exhibits an extremely clear Pi IV ornament.

This coin is from a massive issue that was struck in an apparently hasty manner, a fact suggested by the relatively crude dies that were often 
overused. Many of the known examples are poorly struck, another indication of haste. BCD suggested that this magistrate produced these 
coins around 31 BC, and that the elaborate, diadem-like wreath on the reverse was a reference to Agrippa&apos;s naval victory over the forces of 
Antony and Cleopatra.

The Electrum Coinage of Kyzikos 

The celebrated electrum coinage of Kyzikos began in the first half of the sixth century, and from the beginning the coinage was notable for 
the variety and inventiveness of its designs. These staters and fractions were regarded as gold coins and circulated throughout a large area 
along with the gold darics of the Persian Empire. On all of the coins of Kyzikos, large or small, was engraved the tunny-fish (θυννος), 
which constituted an important product in the Kyzikene economy. The long awaited corpus initiated by the late Friedrich Bodenstedt is now 
being continued by Maria Kaiser-Raiss. In the meantime, we must rely on the synthesis of material put together by Hans von Fritze in 1914, 
augmented (and corrected) by the articles by Sylvia Hurter and Hans-Joachim Liewald. Hurter studied the electrum coinage of Kyzikos for 
some time before her untimely death in 2008. It was her conviction that the arrangement of the coins by Agnes Baldwin Brett in the catalog of 
the Boston Museum of Fine Arts was the most accurate to date (reflected in the &quot;Editor&apos;s note&quot; at the beginning of the article on the Kyzikene 
coins in Moscow and St. Petersburg in SNR 2007). Thus, the coinage of Kyzikos below is arranged accordingly. 

More controversially, Yuri Pokras (&quot;A New Iconography for the Electrum Coins of Kyzikos,&quot; The Celator November 2000, pp.18-26) has 
tried to argue that Athens invested Kyzikos with the status of subsidiary mint, and that the presence of specific types parallels each city-state&apos;s 
inclusion into an alliance with Athens. 

The orator Aristotelis, in the second century BC, stated the following in his speech regarding the people of Kyzikos: &quot;It is enough for one 
just to glance at the location and the nature of this city to immediately understand that the name &apos;blissful&apos; given to it by God was factual, so 
convenient is its land and its sea. As it is built in front of Asia Minor and since its dominion extends from the Black Sea to the Hellespont, 
Kyzikos joins the two seas together or rather all the seas that man navigates. Thus, ships continuously pass by or arrive at the harbor or depart 
from the harbor. Justly it should be called &apos;blissful&apos; just as is Corinth because, as it is built in the mid part of the seas, it joins, as if it was the 
center of the world, all men who sail the Mediterranean from Gibraltar to Kolchis at the far side of the Black Sea.&quot;

Recognizing an Unrecognized Variety 

362.

($3000) 

From the LVL Collection. 

This type is very similar to Von Fritze I 93, but on that issue, the hound/wolf is clearly raising a forepaw (cf. SNG France 230). The appearance 
of this stater now makes it clear that some of the fractions attributed to Von Fritze 93 are actually of the same variety as the present piece, and 
have been known for some time. For instance, the hekte CNG 99, lot 182 is clearly Von Fritze 93, with a forepaw raised, while SNG France 
232 (like the following lot), with forepaw lowered, is not. Unfortunately, on some dies the foreleg is engraved straight out, such that it is not 
possible to discern to which variety a coin can be attributed (cf. SNG France 231 [hekte] and Roma 10, lot 484 [stater]), unless the straight 
leg constitutes even another variety.

Exceptional Winged Monster 
Arguments for Daimon and for Mithraic Areimanios

EF, lightly toned. Well centered, struck from artistic dies. Very rare and exceptional for issue. 
($50,000) 

From the LVL Collection. 

While the identification of this creature, certainly of local significance, is unknown today, it has traditionally been referred to as &quot;Phobos&quot; 
or &quot;Daimon.&quot; In his catalog of the Gulbenkian collection, Jenkins sees an Egyptian or near-Eastern influence, while Bivar, in his article on 
Mithra (&quot;Mithra and Mesopotamia,&quot; Mithraic Studies [Manchester, 1975], pp. 275-89), suggests that the creature corresponds to the Mithraic 
Areimanios (Ahriman). One also may see an assimilation of the ubiquitous Persian lion-headed griffin, adapting the head, wings, and tail to a 
human body. Although some references note the head as being that of a wolf, other examples clearly show a mane that is directly influenced 
by the lion heads on the common early Lydian electrum, supporting Bivar&apos;s (and others&apos;) contention that it is a lion head. At the same time, the 
ear is not fully visible on most examples, but on some, such as the present piece, it clearly is that of a griffin (compare to its depiction on the 
coins of Teos and Abdera). The wings and posture of the creature are mythological archetypes, commonly found on displays of various deities 
and creatures on pottery and coins. An excellent example of an archaic representation of a local deity of Asia Minor.

Aktaion was a famous hunter who learned his skills from the centaur Chiron. One day he accidentally came upon Artemis bathing: she was so 
angered by him seeing her naked that she transformed him into a stag and he was set upon and torn to pieces by his own hunting dogs. Here 
we see the start of the transformation process, with the horn just coming out of his head. This portrait was also used on roughly contemporary 
gold staters at the mint of Lampsakos (cf. SNG France 1145).

This rare type depicts the legend of the omphalos (navel) stone, which marked the sacred precinct of the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi as the 
physical center of the earth. According to tradition, two eagles, which had been released by Zeus, one flying from the east, and the other from 
the west, met exactly at the site of Apollo&apos;s sanctuary. This spot was marked for all to see by the stone omphalos, and designated as the center 
of the earth. The omphalos was a white stone ornamented with stripes of various kinds, and upon it were the representations of the two eagles 
(as seen on this coin type -the tunny fish below is the city-badge of Kyzikos). This scene was frequently represented in vase-paintings, but is 
extremely rare on coinage. The omphalos probably stood on the sacred hearth that was in the center of the temple. 

The origins of Apollo&apos;s temple at Delphi are described in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo. Apollo descended from Mt. Olympos and made his 
way through northern and central Greece until he finally found the proper site for the foundation of his oracle at Crisa under the snow-capped 
Mt. Parnassos. He laid out his temple and then slew a she-dragon which inhabited the area. The name of the site was subsequently called Pytho 
(and Apollo, the Pythian) due to the rotting body of the slain dragon. (The verb pytho, in Greek, means &apos;to rot&apos;.) Interestingly enough, Zeus 
punished Apollo for the murder of the dragon by exiling him to Thessaly for nine years. A religious festival called the Stepteria was celebrated 
every ninth year at Delphi to commemorate these events associated with the foundation myth of the sanctuary. 

After Apollo established his sanctuary, he went about the business of recruiting attendants for the temple. He noticed a ship passing by, 
manned by Cretans from Knossos, and on their way to Pylos. Apollo transformed himself into a dolphin (δελφις, hence the name of the city) 
and leaped aboard the Cretan ship. At first the men tried to throw the dolphin back into the sea, but they were &quot;awed&quot; by it into a &quot;fearful 
submission&quot;. After a lengthy voyage, Apollo led the ship to Crisa, where &quot;he leaped ashore and revealed himself as a god amid a blaze of fiery 
brightness and splendor&quot;. He ordered the Cretan men to perform sacrifices and to pray to him as Apollo Delphinius. He then led them to his 
sanctuary and placed the Cretans in charge, predicting great wealth and prestige for his temple. 

This story linked the early cult of Apollo to Crete and promoted Apollo as the god of sailors and colonization. His oracle at Delphi played 
a major role as the religious impetus for the Greeks in establishing their colonies, hence its importance to the residents of Kyzikos, itself a 
colony of Miletos. The importance of this coin type to Kyzikos may also be found in another story that has the city being settled by the Pelasgi 
from Thessaly, who were driven from Thessaly by the Aeolians. Their king and leader was Kyzikos, a son of Apollo, who gave his name to 
the city and thus established its link to Apollo and his temple at Delphi.

According to Xenophon (Hell. 3.1.6), the cities of Teuthrania and Halisarna were ruled by the brothers Eurysthenes and Prokles, a hereditary 
territory that had been awarded to their ancestor, the exiled king of Sparta, Demaratos the Lakedaimon, by Xerxes for accompanying the Great 
King on his Greek expedition (see Hdt. Book 7 for the relationship between the two). The hereditary rule of Teuthrania and Halisarna by the 
direct descendants of Demaratos, among whom were Eurystenes and Prokles -namesakes of the twin ancestral establishers of the Spartan 
royal line -suggests that these rulers were not satraps, but local dynasts (for a bibliography of the discussion on the differentiation between 
satraps and dynasts, see O. Mørkholm, &quot;Pergamene Coins in Copenhagen,&quot; in Studies Mildenberg, p. 182, note 2). Thus, it is possible that 
ours is one of the earliest depictions of a Greek ruler on a coin.

likely dated circa 420-400 BC, just prior to the silver with sphinx reverse types, and was an issue connected to the Apolline cult present in the 
city. He will integrate this issue into the forthcoming study he is preparing on the mints of the Troad.

From the estate of Thomas Bentley Cederlind. Ex Gorny &amp; Mosch 207 (15 October 2012), lot 287 (hammer €1900). 

Founded in the seventh century BC by Aeolians on the site of ancient Troy, Ilion prospered and ultimately developed into a successful 
Hellenistic and Roman city. It possessed a famous temple of Athena (&apos;Ilias&apos;) that was visited by King Xerxes of Persia and later by Alexander 
the Great. The Romans always had a high regard for Ilion because of the legend of Aeneas and the tradition that Rome&apos;s founders were of 
Trojan origin. With the collapse of Seleukid authority in Asia Minor in 189 BC, Ilion, in common with many other communities of western 
Asia Minor, celebrated its liberation from regal authority by issuing large and impressive tetradrachms. These honor the goddess Athena Ilias, 
whose helmeted head appears as the obverse type, while the reverse features her standing figure, probably the statue which stood within the 
sanctuary. The names appearing on these issues are not technically magistrates, but influential citizens who financed the coinage from their 
own wealth in return for recognition on the coins (see Bellinger, &quot;The First Civic Tetradrachms of Ilium&quot; in ANSMN VIII [1958], pp. 23-24). 
The patronymic form used on this coinage has a parallel in the earlier stephanophoric coinage of Magnesia ad Maeandrum (see Jones).

This interesting issue of electrum staters has been known for some time. Noting the similarity of the reverse punches to electrum staters at Miletos 
with a recumbent lion, Kraay suggested it may have been one of many issues from the early period at that city with this form of punch marks, 
perhaps the earliest, with the city using varying types before settling on a lion as its civic badge. Nevertheless, Kraay also noted that some issues 
with this form of punchmarking had been attributed to cities in Caria and Lydia, so the identification of the mint as Miletos was speculative. 

Until more recent discoveries, though, the subsidiary symbols on the obverse, a flower (lotus?) and rosette, were either not clearly visible or 
missed by catalogers. Although the configuration and style of the reverse punches suggests a date contemporary to the lion staters of Miletos, 
the appearance of these symbols casts doubt on such an early chronology, as subsidiary symbols do not commonly appear on electrum until 
much later. Subsidiary symbols on electrum staters are more common on northwest Anatolian issues of the early 5th century BC. The most 
prominent examples are the various electrum staters typically given to the time of the Ionian Revolt (cf. ACGC 74), and the early issues at 
Lampsakos (cf. Kraay &amp; Hirmer 727). A lotus symbol is also found as a subsidiary symbol on electrum staters that may have been issued in 
Thrace in the late 6th century (cf. Rosen 148-9). Another example is the recently discovered staters featuring a lion lying right with a lotus 
flower above (cf. Linzalone 1174), typically dated to the early 5th century. Interestingly, this issue has a similar configuration of reverse 
punches, though they have a more uniform appearance that suggests a date later than the present specimen. The closest parallel with the 
current stater issue, however, is a stater with a lion lying left with lotus flower above (cf. Rosen 245). The reverse of this issue also has a 
similar configuration of punches, but appears closer to our piece in style. Unfortunately, that issue is known from just one example, and its 
date of issue is unknown. 

Another factor to consider is the combination of rosette and lotus symbols. These two symbols frequently occur together, particularly on 
silver issues from cities in the region of northern Greece during the period that they were under Persian rule. Both the rosette and lotus are 
often found in Persian art. At Persepolis, rosettes of the same form as found on this stater adorn a chariot on the north face of the Apadana, 
they adorn the bridle of a bull fighting a lion and frame the scene on the stairway façade of Palace H, and can be seen on parts of the façade 
of Palace G (now moved to Palace H). In Persian art, the rosette is often used to depict a lotus seen from above, and the same Palace G façade 
also features a column of lotus blossums above the rosettes. E. Herzfeld&apos;s drawings from Persepolis often depict the lotus and rosette used 
in conjunction (see, e.g., Drawing, &quot;Excavation of Persepolis [Iran]: Apadana, East Side, Ceremonial Staircases: Carvings of Palms,&quot; 1905-
1934, FSA A.6 05.0899, Ernst Herzfeld Papers, Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery Archives, Smithsonian Institution). Thus, 
the rosette and lotus have long connections in Persian art, and are often found in conjunction. Their use is also attested in ancient Egyptian art, 
but the importation of the symbols on coins in Asia Minor are more likely a result of Persian influence. 

It seems thus that this coin was issued after the Persians conquered western Asia Minor in the mid 6th century, but probably not much later, as the 
configuration and style of the reverse punches seem closely related to the early staters of Miletos. But what of the interpretation of the design? 
The rosette and lotus symbols are likely to be interpreted as one, rather than two separate images, simply depicting the flower from the side and 
above. Their meaning in Persian art is manifold: divinity, light, heaven, or royal authority are often suggested. More perplexing is the primary 
type, the forepart of a horse. Like the rosette and lotus, horse protomes are well known from Persepolis, particularly as capitals. In essence, the 
design in total, horse forepart with lotus and rosette, can be viewed as intrinsically Persian, and probably is symbolic of Persian authority.

When the Pergamene king Attalos II died in 134 BC, he bequeathed his kingdom to the Romans. Because the Romans were slow in securing 
their claim, Aristonikos, son of the earlier Pergamene king Eumenes II, filled the power vacuum, claiming the throne and taking the dynastic 
name Eumenes. Although he was unable to capture Pergamon, his revolt lasted four years, until he was defeated and captured by the Romans 
under the consul M. Perperna. After his surrender, he was paraded through Rome and executed.

There has been long debate about whether Zagaba was a place or a person, but more recent research has conclusively shown that it is, in fact, 
a city, not a dynast (cf. A.G. Keen, Dynastic Lycia: A Political History of the Lycians &amp; Their Relations with Foreign Powers, c. 545-362 BC 
[Leiden: Brill, 1998], pp. 54-5 and 109). The absence of a dynast&apos;s name here suggests that this issue might be a civic, rather than dynastic 
(cf. Keen, op cit., p. 54, and Reuter 128 note). Coins with similar types as this issue, however, are known in the name of Vekhessere II (cf. 
Falghera 186 and Podalia 1-7).

The portraits on coins in the later Lycian series are among the finest of the Classical period. Among the earliest to attempt depictions of 
their rulers on coinage, the Lycians&apos; first portraits in the later 5th century BC were innovative, but static, idealized forms lacking individual 
characterization. Over the next half-century, however, the style progressed significantly toward realism, culminating in the issues of the 
dynasts Mithrapata and Perikles in the early-mid 4th century BC. The coins of Mithrapata came first, depicting on their reverse the profile 
portrait of a man with distinctive elderly features. Through the relative chronology established in L. Mildenberg&apos;s die study, one can even 
see the portrait become more aged as time progressed, reflecting the realism that had been captured in these issues. The coins of Perikles, 
Mithrapata&apos;s successor, continue this trend, but also have two innovations that set them at the pinnacle of classical portraiture. First, the 
portrait is moved to the obverse of the coin, emphasizing the importance of the individual. Second, and most prominently, the portrait is not 
in the traditional profile, but in a dramatic facing state. Obviously influenced by Kimon&apos;s facing Arethusa-head coinage at Syracuse, these 
depict Perikles looking out from the surface of the coin with a serene countenance and his hair flowing around him as if blown by the wind. 
This depiction captures the essence of the earlier idealized portraits, conveying to the viewer a sense that Perikles was more than a mere man, 
but retaining the realism in its individualized features. Interestingly, both Mithrapata and Perikles are depicted without any sort of satrapal 
headgear, which was always included in earlier Lycian portraits, perhaps indicating that they had declared their independence from the Persian 
king. Unfortunately, these astonishing developments in portraiture came to an abrupt end in Lycia when Maussollos of Caria invaded the 
region circa 360 BC.

($1000) 

Scholars have long known of an ancient city called Ura in Cilicia, but its location is yet unknown (and widely debated). From a numismatic 
standpoint, the obverse iconography suggests an earlier settlement at Kelenderis, which was the location favored by R. Beal in his 1992 study, 
The Location of Cilician Ura. All of the coins previously known depicted a facing owl on the reverse, similar to the reverses of the famous 
Athenian dekadrachms. The present piece, with a very clear obverse legend, is the first to break this pattern, suggesting that the city&apos;s coinage 
was more prolific.

($2000) 

In his section on Kition, Price references No. 3100 (no A on obv./‰ on rev.) to Newell 2, and No. 3105 (A on obv./‰ on rev.) to Newell 7, but 
this is only partially correct, as the presence of the A on the obverse is not determinative of the correct Newell number, but, rather, the position 
of the name of Alexander. Newell 2 has the name to the left of Nike, while Newell 7 has the name on the right. At the same time, Newell 7 
notes that an &apos;A&apos; is present on the obverse only sometimes. Thus, while a stater without the &apos;A&apos; must be Price 3100, it can be either Newell 2 
or Newell 7, depending on the position of Alexander&apos;s name.

Ex Numismatica Ars Classica 78 (26 May 2014), lot 348. 

The Qatabanian series with two male heads (cf. Huth 358-385) stands between the earlier coins in imitation of Athens (for a hybrid type, cf. 
Huth 357) and the emergence of Himyarite coinage in the late first century BC. These coins bear the names of a number of mostly unknown 
rulers, and abound with monograms. As the ruler&apos;s name can be found on either the obverse (as on this coin) or the reverse (Huth 366-367), 
it is unclear to which of the two distinctly different heads it refers, and who the respective other head represents. While the present coin is 
stylistically close to other coins in the name of the same ruler (cf. Huth 359), it seems to add a patronym (Yad&apos;ab Dhubyan, son of Sh[…]).

PERSIA, Achaemenid Empire. temp. Artaxerxes III to Darios III. Circa 350-333 BC. AR Tetradrachm

and kandys, in kneeling-running stance right, holding spear in right hand, bow in left / Incuse rectangle, containing pattern 
possibly depicting relief map of the hinterland of Ephesos. Johnston, Earliest 6; Meadows, Administration 328; Mildenberg, 
Münzwesen pp. 25-6 and pl. XII, 110; BMC Ionia p. 324, 3 and 6; Jameson 1787; Pozzi 3138. Near EF, dark iridescent tone. 
Good metal. 
($10,000) 

Johnston has interpreted this remarkable reverse design as a relief map of the hinterland of Ephesos, which would make it the earliest Greek 
map and first physical relief map known. On the right (north) are the mountains Tmolos and Messogis between the river valleys of the Caÿster 
and Maeander, to the left of which are three mountain ridges (Madranbaba Dagi, Karincali Dagi, and Akaba Tepesi). Johnston follows Six 
in suggesting that the coins were probably struck under the Persian general Memnon at Ephesos, circa 336-334 BC, in order to pay his army 
after he had captured the city, but before his defeat by Alexander at the Battle of Granicus in 334. However, Johnston&apos;s map theory has been 
the subject of some doubt, most notably by Leo Mildenberg.

The obverse appears to have been influenced by the early Alexander types from Babylon, while the revere is more closely related in style to 
the early issues from mints in Cilicia and Phoenicia. All of these prototype issues were from the circa 325-315 BC period, suggesting an early 
date for this issue.

UNCERTAIN EAST. 3rd-2nd centuries BC. AR Tetradrachm (27mm, 15.14 g, 12h). In the name and types of

entwined downward toward wreath. Cf. Price 4038 = Hersh (now BM no. 2002,0101.997 --same obv. die, different symbol), 
and CNG E-357, lot 174 (Price B36 --same obv. die, different symbol). Near EF, toned. 
($300) 

The present coin is part of a series featuring an unusual obverse style and light weight (averaging between 15.5 and 16.5 grams), as well as a 
variety of symbols in the left field on the reverse: lion-skin over club [Price 4058], dolphin downward [Price 4058A (cf. Lanz 161, lot 15)], 
wreath [Price B36], two dolphins entwined over wreath [present coin], and thunderbolt [CNG 90, lot 752, and Rauch Summer Auction 2010, 
lot 54]. While the light weight and style suggest an origin among the eastern Celts, the consistency of the style and good epigraphy suggests 
a more formally organized mint, unlike definitively Celtic issues that copy Alexanders.

In their recent study (see also: http://www.ptolemybronze.com/), Daniel Wolf and Catharine Lorber thoroughly examine a class of the 
&apos;Galatian shield&apos; bronze coinage commonly given to the Alexandreia mint. While the bronze issues with an enigmatic monogram Ï above the 
shield can be attributed to the mint of Alexandreia, those without this control exhibit distinguishing features, with provenances suggesting a 
Sicilian mint. While this theory of a western origin has been posited before, Wolf and Lorber present the first comprehensive investigation of 
the series, accompanied by a die study. Their analysis shows that the initial output of Sicilian &apos;Galatian shield&apos; bronzes appear to have been 
produced under Alexandreian minting specialists, with related &apos;imitative&apos; issues of &apos;Western Greek&apos; style following this period of production 
under Ptolemaic authority. These &apos;Western Greek&apos; style coins were struck with loose dies and share a common fabric, metrology, and border 
style with the Syracusan coinage of Hieron II, as well as featuring shared controls with the coinage struck in Hieron&apos;s name, all indicating a 
Sicilian mint&apos;s operation under Hieron superseding the Ptolemaic, or perhaps the wholesale transfer of the mint (if so, very likely to Syracuse).

The mint and era of this enigmatic coinage has been much debated. For the most recent discussion, see C. Lorber, &quot;The Ptolemaic era coinage 
revisited,&quot; NC (2007), pp. 105-17. Although this issue is traditionally assigned to Arados, Lorber argues for a Cypriot mint, perhaps Arsinoe 
near Salamis. Although the era is uncertain, a starting date of 262/1 BC has been accepted by Lorber and most scholars.

One of Thirteen Known 

706. 
BAKTRIA, Indo-Greek Kingdom. Menander I Soter. Circa 155-130 BC. AV Stater (20mm, 8.57 g, 1h). Draped 
bust of Athena right, wearing crested helmet adorned with wing; all within bead-and-reel border / Owl standing right on ground

lightly toned, area of weak strike on obverse at periphery. Extremely rare, one of 13 specimens known. 
($50,000) 

Unlike his silver and bronze issues, the gold coinage of Menander I Soter is very rare (as is the case with Baktrian gold issues in general). This 
stater, with the helmeted head of Athena on the obverse and an owl on the reverse, is among the rarest, with a total of 13 specimens known (see 
below). Mitchiner questioned the authenticity of some of the specimens he recorded, but did not doubt the British Museum specimen, which 
is struck from the same obverse die as the present coin. Bopearchchi, in a note on the series, repeated Mitchiner&apos;s reservation without further 
elucidation. S. Hurter, in her review of Le portrait d&apos;Alexandre le Grand by O. Bopearachchi and P. Flandrin in SNR 85 (2006), expressed 
doubt about a number of the coins in the Miho Museum and suggested that the Miho Menander (which she had not seen) should undergo 
further examination (pp. 190-1).

Extremely Rare Ahuramazda, Sole Creator God of Zoroastrianism 

713. 
INDIA, Kushan Empire. Huvishka. Circa AD 151-190. AV Dinar (20mm, 7.95 g, 12h). Subsidiary mint in 
Gandhara (Peshawar?). Early phase. sÅO˜Å˜OsÅO O˜s˚i ˚OsÅ˜O, diademed and crowned half-length bust left on clouds

typical worn die. Extremely rare. 
($20,000) 

One of the rarest reverse types in all of Kushan coinage, Ahuramazda (ahura [lord or mighty] and mazda [spirit or intelligence]) was the sole 
creator of heaven and earth and all life, and the supreme deity in the Zoroastrian pantheon. As the creator and upholder of the concept of asha 
(truth or right[eousness]), Ahuramazda was the supporter and guardian of justice and ally of the just man. As such, he became the protective 
divinity of the Achaemenids and the rulers of Persis (where he is depicted as a profile bust set into a quasi-Egyptian winged solar disk), as 
well as the Sasanian kings, who included him in the obverse legend of their coins (mzd&apos;ysn [the Mazda worshipper]). Beginning with the 
Achaemenids, Ahuramazda became associated with the god Mithra and the goddess Anahita. While Mithra (as Miiro and Mioro) and Anahita 
(as Ardoxsho) were regularly incorporated into the pantheon of Kushan deities depicted on their coinage, the appearance of Ahuramazda on 
Kushan coins is rare. Given his hieratic importance, one might expect him to appear more frequently in connection to Kushan royalty. It is 
possible, however, that the Kushans were hesitant to include the supreme god on such a secular object as coinage (the same hesitancy occurred 
with issues of the Buddha), where, as John H. Rosenfield noted (p.83) &quot;less exalted elements of the pantheon would be more congenial.&quot;

Antinoüs was by birth from Bithynium beyond the river Sangarius, and the Bithynians are by descent Arcadians of Mantinea. For this 
reason, the emperor established his worship in Mantinea also; mystic rites are celebrated in his honor each year, and games every four years 
(Pausanias VIII.9.7). 

Part of a series of commemorative medallions/coins struck in five denominations, no doubt in association with one of the events described by 
Pausanias. They feature a common reverse type of a horse, symbol of Poseidon Hippios, patron deity of Mantinea (where they would have 
been used, if not actually struck). The legends on the pieces simply tell us that they were dedicated to the Arcadians by a certain Vetourios.

Alexandria saw an immense output of coinage during the eighth year of Antoninus Pius&apos;s reign. The Zodiac drachms, mythological types, 
and a host of issues for the nomes appeared that year. One explanation for this activity centers on the celebration of the renewal of the Great 
Sothic cycle, the point when the star Sothis (Sirius) rises on the same point on the horizon as the sun. This cycle of 1461 years began early 
in the reign of Pius in AD 139, and apparently prompted a renewal in the ancient Egyptian religion, while the coin types also stressed the 
connections to the Greco-Roman Pantheon.

Restored Issue Under Trajan-Hadrian 

842. 
Augustus. 27 BC-AD 14. AR Denarius (20mm, 3.74 g, 6h). Restitution issue. Rome mint. Struck under Trajan-
Hadrian, circa 98-138 AD. Laureate head right / Gaius and Lucius Caesar standing facing, each resting hand on shield set 
on ground; behind the shields, two crossed spears; above, on left, a simpulum left, and on right, lituus right. RIC I -; RSC -; 
BMCRE 536, pl. 13, 18 corr. (misattributed to the reign of Augustus). Good VF, toned, a few light marks and scratches. Very 
rare. 
($1000) 

The style and fabric of this coin suggest that it belongs to an anonymous restitution issue of either Trajan or Hadrian. The restitution issues of 
Trajan are well known since the coins are marked with Trajanic legends. The fact that this coin retains its original legend without any mention 
of the issuer suggests that it is not part of the great restitution series of Trajan, but part of an earlier or later anonymous issue. Apart from style, 
on all known specimens the lituus has a split base and is turned to the right, and the simpulum is large, rather bulbous, and turned to the left, 
features not seen on the issues of Augustus.

The denarius of Tiberius with Pax reverse is commonly known as the &apos;Tribute Penny,&apos; the coin to which Jesus referred when he was discussing 
the payment of taxes to the Romans: &quot;render to Caesar the things that are Caesar&apos;s, and to God the things that are God&apos;s&quot; (Mark 12:17). 
Although there are two other reverse types on the denarii of Tiberius, those were only issued during the first two years of his reign, while the 
Pax reverse was employed throughout the remainder, making it the more likely coin referred to. It was also the most common imperial-issue 
coin circulating in the region at the time. The term &apos;penny&apos; is from the 1611 King James translation of the Bible, and was adopted since the 
penny was the standard denomination of the time.

Pax-Nemesis on a Vespasian Aureus 

896. 
Vespasian. AD 69-79. AV Aureus (21mm, 7.27 g, 8h). Lugdunum (Lyon) mint. Struck AD 72. IMP CAES VESPAS 
AVG P M TR P IIII P P COS IIII, laureate head right / PACI AVGVSTI, Pax-Nemesis advancing right, pulling out fold of drapery 
and holding winged caduceus pointed at snake gliding right, head erect. RIC II 1180; Lyon 56; Calicó 656. VF. ($3000) 

The figure of Pax-Nemesis is a novel type for Roman coinage, and its use here with the legend PACI AVGVSTI is a continuation of the type 
from the reign of Claudius. Pax equals Peace, but Nemesis is the personification of divine vengeance, and is typically represented meting out 
punishment for an insolent act. In this case, though, Nemesis is represented as the fear of divine vengeance that prescribes moderation. The 
wings and serpent are typically associated with Victory and Minerva Victrix, and suggests that the moderation is related to triumph, most 
likely Vespasian&apos;s subjugation of Judaea. Regardless, the type implies that Vespasian would exercise self-restraint, and that this restraint 
would precipitate the peace noted by the legend.

It is tempting to tie this coin into Titus&apos; defeat and capture of Jerusalem in October AD 70, but the Judaea campaign was land-based. According 
to Harold Mattingly in his introduction to the Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum, &quot;Victoria Navalis on her prow demands a 
word of explanation. Laffranchi has suggested a definite commemoration of Actium, and he is probably right in so far as a parallel is drawn 
between Augustus and Vespasian, both victorious in the East. But there had been little naval fighting in the Jewish war, and the Civil War, to 
which veiled reference might be made, had been won on land, against the advice, or even the orders of the Emperor. The official policy of 
Vespasian had been that of a slow but certain victory by blockade of Rome from Egypt; and it is to call attention to the wisdom and importance 
of this policy that the coins were designed.&quot;

A heretofore unknown and unpublished aureus for Nerva with the reverse legend of IMP II COS IIII P P. This Aequitas type is known for a 
denarius (RIC II 44), but only as an aureus with the AEQVITAS AVGVST reverse inscription. For this particular issue, there are six denarii 
types with only three corresponding aurei types (Fortuna, priestly implements, and clasped hands with legionary aquila on prow), so it stands 
to reason that the three previously unlisted aurei types (Aequitas-this coin, Libertas, and clasped hands) may eventually come to light.

Between the years AD 119 and 136, the emperor Hadrian travelled throughout the Roman Empire, visiting various provinces to take stock of 
his inheritance and calm the disquiet, which had arisen in the later years of Trajan&apos;s reign. His travels can be divided into two major episodes. 
The first tour was designed to shore-up Rome&apos;s northern borders and began sometime around AD 119, when Hadrian first visited the provinces 
of Gaul and Germania Inferior and Superior. The emperor then crossed the Channel to Britannia where, during his stay, construction began on 
a seventy-three-mile long wall across the north of the province, known to this day as Hadrian&apos;s Wall. In AD 122-123, Hadrian spent time in 
Hispania, then travelled east to Asia Minor. The remainder of this first tour was spent in the Balkans and Greece, touring such areas as Dacia 
and Achaea, before returning to Rome, via Sicily, in AD 126. 

Hadrian&apos;s second tour began in AD 128, when he set out on a short tour of the provinces of Africa and Mauretania. Returning for a brief stay 
in Rome, in AD 130 Hadrian then went again to Asia Minor, and continued into Syria, Judaea, Palestine, and, finally, Egypt. The bar-Kochba 
revolt in Judaea forced Hadrian to remain in the region until AD 135. In AD 136, Hadrian returned to Italia, ending his long travels.

Hadrian&apos;s Idealized Portrait 
Posthumous Issue Under Antoninus Pius 

958. 
Hadrian. AD 117-138. AV Aureus (19mm, 7.19 g, 6h). Rome mint. Posthumous issue struck under Antoninus Pius, 
July-October AD 138. HADRIANVS AVGVSTVS, youthful, bareheaded bust right, aegis at point of bust / COS III • P • P, 
Hadrian, in military attire, standing left, extending right hand and holding spear with left; aquila and signum to left; signum to 
right. RIC II 204b (same obverse die); P.V. Hill, The Undated Coins of Rome, pp. 78-9, and &quot;Abnormal Hadrianic Portraits,&quot; 
NumCirc LXXIV.7-8 (July-August 1966), p. 179 and pl. II, 5 (same obv. die); Strack 331Do; Calicó 1239 (same obv. die as 
illustration); BMCRE 530 (same obv. die); Biaggi 601 (same dies). Near VF, a few light scratches. 
($3000) 

Several of Hadrian&apos;s aurei appear with a younger, more idealized portrait; the obverse legends, however, date these coins to the later years of 
his reign. An aureus (Hunter 180) of the same type and issue date as our coin clearly shows an older portrait, consistent with a man who was 
in his early 60s. Two similar aurei, but with the IOVI VICTORI reverse type, show the same divergence of portraiture (S 3397 [older bust]; S 
4540 [younger bust]). Although these idealized-portrait issues have two legend varieties, each datable to different periods in Hadrian&apos;s reign, 
there is die linkage within this small group indicating that they were contemporaneous issues. The latest datable legend would place them 
within the last issues of Hadrian&apos;s reign, circa 134-138 AD. Nonetheless, the idealized portraiture is so different from the bulk of the coinage 
theoretically struck at the same time, that it is clear that this group was not struck in this period, either. Therefore, they must be placed after 
this period, after Hadrian&apos;s death. The portraiture itself is key; its idealized nature suggests that these coins are posthumous issues (compare 
with the various &apos;restitution&apos; issues of earlier reigns). 

It is known that Antoninus Pius quarreled with the Senate for a period over the question of Hadrian&apos;s deification. During this time, it is believed 
that Pius refused to issue his own coinage and refused to accept his accession unless the deification was granted. A survey of the reverse types 
known for this idealized-portrait issue reveals they focus on the divine nature of Hadrian&apos;s predecessor and adopted father, Trajan (cf. S 4538-
9). Others focus on Jupiter, a divinity with imperial associations. As this coinage must be posthumous, this, combined with the portraiture, 
suggests that this issue is related to the divine qualities of Hadrian himself. Such propaganda would have been useful for Pius&apos; cause in urging 
Hadrian&apos;s deification, and must have been struck at Pius&apos; behest. After succeeding in this cause, in recognition of Antoninus&apos; efforts to deify 
his predecessor, he was granted the cognomen Pius by the Senate.

Unique LEG XXII Septimius Severus Aureus 

1030. 
Septimius Severus. AD 193-211. AV Aureus (20mm, 7.06 g, 12h). Legionary series. Rome mint. Struck AD 193. 
IMP CAE • L • SEP • SE V • PERT • AVG, laureate head right / LEG XX II, TR P COS in exergue, legionary aquila between 
two signa; forepart of capricorn on the shaft of each signum. Unpublished, but cf. RIC IV 15 and RSC 276 for denarii of this 
type; cf. illustration of Calicó 2471 (LEG VIII) for obverse die. Near EF, areas of toning, shroff mark below Severus&apos; chin,

($25,000) 

This heretofore unpublished and very important aureus is a new type (Legion XXII) to be included with the four previously recorded gold 
types in the extensive &apos;legionary&apos; series issued by Severus at the very outset of his reign. According to Dio Cassius (XLVI, 46, 7), Severus 
paid an accession donative of 250 denarii (ten aurei) per man, and in all likelihood the legionary coinage was specially struck for this purpose. 
Legio XXII Primigenia was one of the legions to receive special honors from the new emperor as it supported his bid for the purple. Founded 
in AD 39 by Gaius (Caligula) as part of his campaigns in Germania, the XXII Primigenia spent much of their time in Mogontiacum (modern 
Mainz) up to the end of 3rd century.

Divus Septimius Severus. Died AD 211. AR Antoninianus (22mm, 4.49 g, 6h). Rome mint, 6th officina. 8th emission 
of Trajan Decius, mid AD 251. Radiate head right / Lit altar. RIC IV 96 (Decius); RSC 800. EF, lustrous. Rare. 
($500) 

When Decius became emperor shortly after the millenium of Rome, he attempted to garner support by restoring the traditional Roman 
religion. However, by this time the old Roman pantheon was no longer in vogue. Therefore, Decius issued a series of coins commemorating 
the deified emperors. The list of rulers commemorated, eleven in all, falls short of the total then residing with Jupiter on Olympus, and 
there is no explanation as to why the series lacks such figures as the deified Julius Caesar, Claudius, Lucius Verus, Pertinax or Caracalla. To 
further confuse matters, the series does include one emperor who was never deified and whose appearance thus remains an enigma -Severus 
Alexander. 

In RIC IV, Mattingly rather unconvincingly attributed the &apos;Divus&apos; types struck under Decius to the mint at Milan. Via a study of die-linkage 
using British Museum specimens, as well as examples that have appeared in various auctions over the years, K.J.J. Elks has since refuted 
Mattingly&apos;s attribution, placing the &apos;Divi&apos; series in the last issue of Decius struck at Rome (see &quot;Reattribution of the Milan Coins of Trajan 
Decius to the Rome Mint,&quot; NumChron 1972, pp. 111-115 and pls. 14-15).

During the last five years of her life, following the murder of her younger son Geta in AD 212, Julia Domna virtually ran the government while 
Caracalla embarked on various military adventures. The emperor was much troubled by illness throughout his sole reign. On his way to the 
Parthian War in AD 214, he even visited the great shrine of Aesculapius at Pergamum in the hopes of finding a cure, an occasion marked by 
the striking of a remarkable series of medallic bronzes at the city. 

This rare and attractive As of Julia Domna, issued at Rome in AD 214, is on the same theme and records vows for the health of Caracalla 
undertaken by the Vestal Virgins in a ceremony before the Temple of Vesta. The four Vestals are accompanied by two children and the 
sanctuary itself appears as a small domed structure in the background. Over the centuries no fewer than seven temples of Vesta occupied the 
site in the Forum at the northern corner of the house of Vestals. Most were the victims of fire, the sixth temple having been destroyed late in 
the reign of Commodus (AD 191). Julia Domna herself built the seventh, and the partially reconstructed ruins of this building are still to be 
seen today.

In early AD 216, Caracalla assembled a substantial force of at least eight legions along the Syrian frontier for what would prove to be his 
final victory. The Parthian empire had been engaged in a civil war since 213, with Vologases V in control of half the empire and Artabanus 
V in control of the other half. Caracalla took advantage of this division and sided with Artabanus, even proposing marriage with Artabanus&apos; 
daughter to cement the alliance. The plan went awry, however, and Caracalla marched against an unprepared Artabanus. After ravaging the 
countryside east of the Tigris unhindered, Caracalla returned to Edessa to spend the winter. It is this &quot;victory&quot; that is celebrated on this coin. 
Caracalla, no doubt, would also have assumed the title Parthicus and celebrated a fourth acclamation as imperator had his life not been 
suddenly cut short in Carrhae on 8 April 217.

This issue of denarii only came to light with the appearance of one in the 1986 Elmen sale (noted above), which was purchased by George 
His (a renowned collector of Gordian III), who later donated it to the ANS. Previously, no denarii were known for the issues with TR P II. 
However, this may be merely a normal issue for which few coins remain today, since two other denarii are known with TR P II, although with 
a slightly different variety of Gordian&apos;s obverse legend. Axel Jürging&apos;s article on Gordian&apos;s first emission (in JNG XLV [1995]) notes that both 
of these legends were used simultaneously. One of the two denarii has the same reverse type as the present coin (the other ANS piece noted 
above), while the other has a different reverse type (Fides [also ex His Collection, Triton V, lot 2079]). Interestingly, there is a fourrée TR P 
II denarius with a Providentia reverse type (ANS 1985.140.181), that suggests there may have been an official issue with that reverse type. In 
any event, all three of these reverse types are known for TR P II antoniniani, so their use on denarii is not unexpected.

In AD 217, the Colosseum was struck by lightning and damaged. Repairs were begun under Elagabalus, but the amphitheater was not deemed 
usable again until early in the reign of Severus Alexander, as attested by both the Historia Augusta and a special issue of coins depicting the 
Colosseum. A revival of the Colosseum type on medallions of Gordian III, such as the present specimen, may indicate that restoration work 
continued as late as AD 238 (see BMCRE VI, p. 54). 

On the other hand, the obverse legend of this medallion could point to a later date. J.M.C. Toynbee draws a parallel with another medallion 
dated to AD 244, which depicts the emperor presiding (metaphorically) over games in the Circus. Toynbee suggests that the Colosseum 
medallion was also struck to commemorate games presented by the emperor, presumably in honor of his recent Persian victory (see Roman 
Medallions, pp. 111, 165, &amp; 200).

Although not listed for the Nicomedia mint by either RIC or RSC, the type is known for Heraclea with the mintmark SMH (RIC VIII 12, RSC 
2B). One could argue that the very clear and delineated N in the mintmark of this coin is an H, but it is also possible that it is an unpublished 
type for the Nicomedia mint. On the other hand, the type is known for Constantius II at Nicomedia with the mintmark SMNA (RIC VIII 3, 
RSC 4b), which would seem to indicate that this coin is from Heraclea with a poorly engraved H in the mintmark. Also, the author of RIC

From the estate of Thomas Bentley Cederlind. 

The Ptolemaic cult of Serapis and Isis enjoyed great popularity throughout Hellenistic and Roman times, and indeed the Romans, like the 
Greeks and Persians before them, were fascinated by the culture and monuments of ancient Egypt. The Ptolemies and the Roman emperors 
were not content with just being the foreign rulers of Egypt, but wanted to be viewed as legitimate successors of the Pharaohs. To this end, 
the Romans portrayed themselves as Pharaohs to the native population and even promoted the import of certain aspects of Egyptian culture 
and religion to their own native lands. The Egyptian concept of the Pharaoh as a god was appealing to the Roman emperors (the aging Julius 
Caesar was especially taken with this concept during his romance with Cleopatra). 

The Isis festival was a major celebration in Rome in the 3rd and 4th centuries, heralding the arrival of the ship of Isis (navigium Isidis) from 
Alexandria on 5 March. Besides Isis and Horus, other members of the Egyptian pantheon appear-Serapis, Anubis, Harpocrates, and Nilus. 
Such coins or tokens with imperial busts were first struck by Diocletian at Rome to mark the arrival of the ship, and the tradition continued 
through the 4th century; the latest imperial bust to appear is that of Valentinian II. Alföldi proposes that in the Middle Ages the festival 
associated with the Isis ship (also known as carrus navalis) became the car naval or carnival.

Two Extremely Rare Issues from the Revolt of the Heraclii

Revolt of the Heraclii. 608-610. AE Follis (29mm, 9.26 g, 6h). Mint in Cyprus, 1st officina. Dated year 3 (610). 
Facing busts of Heraclius, on left, and his father, the exarch Heraclius, on right, both crowned and wearing consular robes;

CoinArchives. 
($1500) 

Beginning in 608, the exarch of Africa and his son, both named Heraclius, began issuing coinage in opposition to that of the unpopular 
Byzantine emperor Phocas. This coinage named and depicted the Heraclii as consuls (though neither held the title at that time) rather than 
as emperors, a political move that promoted the Heraclii as champions of the people, not merely rivals to the throne. The revolt culminated 
with Heraclius the younger&apos;s coup at Constantinople, where he was welcomed by the population, crowned, and saw to the execution of his 
predecessor in 610.

Struck during the Sasanian siege of Jerusalem, which lasted from April-May of 614. Two follis variants were issued, one with a mint-mark in 
the exergue and one with XCNIKA. A developing flaw on an obverse die used for both variants indicates that the folles with ethnic were issued 
first, those with &quot;Christ conquers&quot; apparently struck as the situation became increasingly desperate (Bendall p. 313). Interestingly, although 
struck four years into Heraclius&apos; reign, these folles still copy the portrait of Phocas.

After Constantine V, brother-in-law of Artavasdus, succeeded Leo III, Artavasdus attacked him en route to a campaign against the Umayyads 
and usurped the throne. Artavasdus&apos; reign saw an overturn of Leo&apos;s strict iconoclastic policies, but his orthodox efforts would ultimately be 
short-lived and his restoration of the icons in turn reversed. Artavasdus&apos; forces were defeated by Constantine V in the summer of 743. On 2 
November of the same year, he and his son Nicephorus, whom he had raised to co-emperor, had their eyes put out in the Hippodrome.

The Usurper Theodore Mancaphas 

1205. 
Theodore Mancaphas. Usurper in Philadelphia, circa 1188-1189 and circa 1204-1206. BI Trachy (28mm, 2.34 g, 6h).

The coinage of Theodore Mancaphas (Theodore &quot;the fool&quot;) was first published in 1967 -although unattributed at the time -and has been 
assigned to various rulers since (see DOC pp. 393-395 for alternatives to the Mancaphas attribution and Philip Grierson&apos;s sound rejection of 
them). Indeed, we are explicitly told by the contemporary historian Nicetas Choniates that Mancaphas struck coinage with his name and image 
(although he states, surely incorrectly, in silver -with only electrum and highly debased billon issues surviving today).

By the time the last Byzantine emperor, Constantine XI, succeeded his brother John VIII on the throne, the Byzantine Empire consisted of 
a small parcel of land in Morea and the city of Constaninople. When the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II finally decided to eliminate what had 
become a minor nuisance to the Turks, the final result was inevitable. Constantinople was taken by siege, and Constantine died fighting at 
the battlements, rejecting the pleas of his courtiers to flee to safety. His heroic and gruesome death (his body was so mutilated that it was 
only identifiable by his clothing) led to a popular legend that Constantine had never died, and would return at some point in the future to free 
Greece from her conquerors. 

The current lot comes from a hoard of coins of John VIII and Constantine XI published by Simon Bendall in 1991. Prior to the hoard, the 
coinage of Constantine was only known from two specimens. Bendall believed the eighth stavrata of Constantine to be &quot;prime contenders for 
being the very last coins struck in the Byzantine Empire&quot; (p. 141), and thought those with the shortened &quot;KC&quot; form of the emperor&apos;s name 
to be the final eighth stavrata to be struck. Several contemporary sources specifically tell us that Constantine ordered sacred vessels to be 
removed from churches and melted down to strike coins as payment to his soldiers (Bendall pp. 140-141).

($5000) 

The last of the Lombard kings to rule in Italy, Desiderius was not a member of the royal family, but an important officer in the royal court. 
Upon the death of his predecessor, Aistulf, Desiderius was appointed king. Like his predecessors, Desiderius hoped to expand Lombardic 
power in Italy, but this policy led to conflict with the papacy and the southern Italian dukedoms, including Benevento and Spoleto, all of 
whom had been moving closer to the Carolingian sphere of influence. Desiderius was able to exercise control over the southern dukedoms. 
His attempt to intervene in papal affairs was less successful; his appointee, the Antipope Philip reigned for only a single day. And to achieve 
a rapprochement with the Carolingians, Desiderius gave his daughter, Desiderata, in marriage to Charlemagne. The marriage lasted only 
briefly and Desiderata was soon returned to her father. This, combined with Desiderius&apos; support of Gerberga, the widow of Charlemagne&apos;s 
brother, Carloman I, resulted in a war between the Carolingians and the Lombards. Desiderius was eventually defeated and forced to retire to 
a monastery where he died.

This is the sole silver coin type bearing the name of Chingiz Khan. It was apparently a long-lived issue, evidenced by a declining silver quality, 
from fine silver to nearly bronze. Good silver issues, as the present coin, are fairly rare. The obverse has the titles and name of Chingiz, while 
the reverse has the name and title of the reigning Abbasid caliph. The striking date of this issue is based on SICA 9, with the commentary that 
these coins are &quot;believed to have been struck at Ghazna during the Mongol pursuit of Jalal al-Din Khwarizmshah in [AH] 617-618.&quot;

This coin is struck from official dies taken from the English mint of York, muling the Crux type of AEthelred II on the obverse and on the 
reverse AEthelred&apos;s Intermediate Small Cross type by the York moneyer Arnketill. Malmer&apos;s die study of the Anglo-Scandinavian coinage 
solidified the view that three geographic groups exist, correlating generally to the medieval kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. 
These dies are extensively linked to a chain that falls in the &apos;southern&apos; group. It is thought that the coins of this group were likely struck in the 
Danish kingdom at the mint of Lund, with some possibly belonging to Sigtuna. Although these coins imitating the Anglo-Saxon series were 
struck until c. 1020, when Cnut the Great was striking his own coinage, this particular type, among the earliest issues, probably did not even 
last to the end of the reign of Svend Forkbeard.

1290. 
DENMARK. Stridsperioden (Civil War). 1044-1047. AR Penny (18mm, 0.62 g). Imitation of Edward the 
Confessor Radiate/Small Cross type. Odense mint. Radiate and draped bust left / Short cross pattée. Hauberg 4; SCBI 18

The &apos;Stridsperioden&apos; (literally meaning a &apos;time of dispute&apos;) is the name given by Danish historians to the period when rival Danish 
and Norwegian claimants (Magnus den Gode, Harald Hardråde, and Svend Estridsen) fought for the Danish throne. This type is struck 
posthumously in the name of the King of All England, Aethelred II (978-1016), giving the coin a degree of anonymity which the Danish 
moneyers desired, thereby keeping the coin as well as their work neutral in a time of conflict. Undoubtedly, this piece is an exceptional rarity 
and curiosity within both Scandinavian and British early coinages.

This example is a variety of the one sold in The New York Sale XIV (lot 640). Appended to the description, the cataloger there noted: 

This coin is widely believed to have been struck during Charles II&apos;s reign at Mumbai. The Persian legends on both sides have not been 
read successfully though it has great resemblance with that of the Rupees of James II and William and Queen Mary. The earliest East India 
Company coinage bearing Persian inscriptions began to circulate during the time of Charles II. In 1763, Martin Folkes reported that &quot;the 
English Merchants trading in the East Indies struck silver money in India for the use of their factory at Bombaim. Of these he had seen the 
Anglina, Pax Deo and a third sort of rupee which had again only the Company&apos;s arms on the one side and Arabic or Indian characters on the 
other.&quot; Pridmore says that the Surat Council&apos;s comment upon the inscription &apos;Charles the second, King of England&apos; perhaps indicates that 
while the obverse was the normal Anglina type, the reverse was inscribed in Persian with that above inscription. The above coin has Persian 
inscriptions on both sides. In 1681, a pirate named Henry Bridgeman (also known as Every) attacked and captured a ship called the Ganj-e-
Sawai carrying a cargo of 6 Lakhs of Rupees and many people returning from the Haj. His capture of the ship and abuse of the people aboard 
outraged the Indian Princes on the Western Coast. Mughal chronicler Khafi Khan recorded: &quot;This loss was reported to Aurangzeb, and the 
newswriters of the port of Surat sent some rupees which the English had coined at Bombay, with a Superscription containing the name of 
their impure King. Aurangzeb then ordered that the English factors who were residing at Surat for commerce should be seized. Orders were 
also given to Itimad Khan, superintendent of the Port of Surat, and Sisi Yakut Khan, to make preparations for besieging the fort of Bombay.

Ex Ranieri 4 (26 October 2012), lot 439. 

Alessandro Farnese was the son of Ottavio Farnese, the second Duke of Parma, and Margaret, the illegitimate daughter of the Holy Roman 
emperor, Charles V. His mother&apos;s status in no way hindered her relations with her half-brother Philip II; in turn, Alessandro Farnese appears 
to have enjoyed a similar relationship with his uncle. In 1578, he was appointed Governor General of the Netherlands. A keen warrior who 
fought at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, he had the opportunity to display his military skills against the Netherlandish rebels who had since 
revolted against Spain. As a result, Farnese was able to return the southern provinces to the Spanish throne, a process that was concluded with 
the Treaty of Arras in 1579. 

Alessandro Farnese is somewhat better known for his role in the events of the Spanish Armada. Succeeding his father as Duke of Parma in 
1586 (from which title Farnese is more famously remembered), he continued to remain in the Netherlands and attempted to get royal sanction 
to invade England immediately, which was actively supporting the Dutch rebels, and hope for a native Catholic insurrection against the 
government. Although he overruled Parma in this, since his commander would be without naval support, Philip nevertheless thought enough 
of the plan to begin assembling the fleet that would become the Armada. Once the Armada was able to coordinate with Parma&apos;s forces, the 
invasion of England would take place. Miscommunication, however, between the Armada&apos;s commander, Medina Sidonia, and Parma, along 
with the Anglo-Dutch victory at Gravelines, as well as the increasingly unfavorable weather, defeated the Armada and its purpose. Following 
the defeat of the Armada, Parma broke camp at Dunkirk, which was to be his launching point, and retired. 

Shortly after Gravelines, when the threat of invasion was still a possibility, the Earl of Leicester assembled an army at Tilbury, on the Thames 
estuary, where it was thought that the invaders would strike. There, Elizabeth I visited the troops and is reported to have presented a speech 
designed to raise their morale. In what is probably its most famous section, the Duke of Parma (or any invader) is viewed with scorn: 

I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king -and of a King of England too, and think foul 
scorn that Parma or Spain, or any prince of Europe, should dare to invade the borders of my realm.

The earliest coinage of Java consists of irregular cut ingots stamped with a sandalwood flower. The majority examples are known in silver, 
but scattered gold finds are also recorded (Wicks 1986, pg. 57 and 74) These early precious-metal pieces would have had too great a value 
for regular circulation in the marketplace and presumably functioned as wealth storage or ritualistically, though they also would have a place 
in international trade (Wicks 1986, pg. 64-5).

This unusual coin belongs to an unstudied series from the Malay archipelago. The series apparently consists of a variety of tin pieces bearing 
various animals, often with a letter or a floral reverse (cf. Elsen 128, 1639-45), and a single gold type. The metals are linked by virtue of a 
shared type, the fish with a complex and as-yet unread reverse legend (Elsen 126, lot 1365). It is not yet clear what weight standard these 
gold pieces belong to, with known examples weighing between 17.21 and 18.24 grams, all from the same dies. It is possible that, rather than 
a proper coinage, these pieces are currency ingots struck on a variable standard.

The English crown was never particularly concerned with supplying the American colonists with coinage. Early settlers in New England had 
to make due with bartered goods, Native American wampum, and whatever scraps of coinage trickled up from the Spanish territories to the 
far south. Such a situation was untenable for the booming markets of Boston, yet coinage was considered a royal prerogative, and without 
permission of the monarch the colonial officials were hamstrung. In 1652, with the dissolution of the monarchy and the establishment of the 
Commonwealth of England, officials in Boston were at last free to take matters into their own hands. 

On 26-27 May 1652, the General Court of Massachusetts Bay Colony authorized the creation of a mint to strike silver shillings, sixpence, and 
threepence. These represent the earliest coinage struck in what is today the United States. Four separate issues were struck: the NE issues, 
crude types bearing only the letters NE and the denomination; the Willow Tree issues, with a willow tree for the obverse type; the Oak Tree 
issues, with an oak; and the Pine Tree issues, with a pine tree. These series were struck over a number of years, until the mintmasters&apos; contracts 
expired in 1682. All coins bear a fixed date of 1652, the date of authorization. Early collectors believed that this date was used to deceive 
English officials into believing the series was only struck during the Commonwealth, though this seems highly unlikely, as documentary 
evidence clearly demonstrates that the monarchy was well aware of New England&apos;s silver coinage.

Good VF, toned. Very rare. 
($500) 

Though described as a mule of types 30b and 8, this is likely a slight miscategorization. Type 30b is attributed to a mint in the East Midlands, 
while type 8 is given to a mint in Frisia, perhaps Domburg. The reverse engraving features a somewhat &apos;scratchy&apos; style, with only a single 
pellet end for the degraded TOTII on the reverse. In contrast, the Frisian types all appear to have &apos;thicker&apos; style, with two pellet ends on each 
reverse element. Furthermore, while no matches were found at Domburg, nine examples are in the Early Medieval Corpus of Coin Finds that 
were recorded from finds in England, including the present example. 

1415.

($750) 

There has been some discussion as to how this sceat, with the obverse figure standing right rather than facing, should be classified. Metcalf 
dismisses it as an imitation (Metcalf p. 480), relating it to Series N, while Rigold (&quot;The Principal Series of English Sceattas,&quot; in BNJ 47 
[1977]) and the BM assign it to Series O, type 40. Abramson gives it as a variant of type 40.

Eadwald would appear to have profited from the succession crisis in the Mercian royal house after the death of Offa in 796. He seized power 
in East Anglia, retaining control for a number of years before Mercian hegemony was reasserted under Coenwulf. He is only known from his 
coins.

Viking Coin Weight 

1421. 
ANGLO-SAXON, Anglo-Viking (Danish East Anglia)(?). Late 9th century. PB 1½ Eyrir (1.5 Ounce?) Weight 
(21mm, 35.85 g). Circular lead weight, obverse inset with Series K, type 32a sceat. Cf. G. Williams, &quot;Anglo-Saxon and Viking 
Coin Weights,&quot; in BNJ 69 (1999), no. 5 (for a similar lead weight with inset Porcupine-type sceat). For inset: Abramson 
38.40.10; SCBI 63 (BM), 490; SCBC 803C-D. Much as made. Very rare and interesting. 
($1500) 

Williams&apos; analysis of the known weights of this type clearly places them in the Danelaw during the later ninth century, when the Viking 
economy was still bullion-based, and weights were used for weighing both coinage and bullion. 

The purpose of the coins set into these weights remains uncertain, but Williams suggests that they served both a decorative and a practical 
function as a symbol of authority. Although the Viking economy was still pre-monetary, Williams notes that the Vikings were familiar with 
coinage and likely recognized that coin designs represented state authority. He also suggests that the Vikings were probably familiar with 
Anglo-Saxon coin weights, which were validated by the virtue of being stamped with official dies, and argues that the lack of coin dies for use 
on their own weights was remedied by applying a coin within each. Williams points out that the fact that some of the coins used were issued by 
Anglo-Saxon kings would have been irrelevant, as the vast majority of the Vikings were illiterate. The present example supports this idea, as 
the coin inset, a Series K, type 32a sceat struck in east Kent, should have mostly fallen out of circulation in England by this time. Accordingly, 
the weight could not have been used to validate only a particular series.

Beyond this issue of AEthelstan, the York moneyer Nother/Nothhere is only known on a unique coin in the name of the Norse king Anlaf 
Sihtricsson, struck after his retaking of the city in 941 (Forum Hoard 385 = M. Dolley, op. cit., p. 4, c), and the later portrait issue of Eadmund 
(cf. CTCE p. 197, 268). At the same time, there is a portrait coin of Eadred with a moneyer Nother, but with an enigmatic mint signature 
BI, which may indicate Bedford (cf. CTCE 260 [incorrectly listing the coin under Eadmund, although the illustration of the coin on plate 23 
clearly shows the obverse reading Eadred]). Whether this is the same moneyer, moved to another mint, though, is uncertain.

Found on the Thames River foreshore at Battersea, 1983. 

AEthelstan was a remarkably successful monarch who managed to establish dominion over the whole of the island of Britain, having driving 
the Danes from York and received the submission of Constantine of Scotland, Hywel Dda of Wales, and Owain of Strathclyde, and Ealdred 
of Northumbria. Ruling over these diverse people required a new, centralized government ruled through ealdormen and advised by the Royal 
Council. AEthelstan also reformed legal codes, standardized the coinage, and promoted the church. Unfortunately, his kingdom did not survive 
long after his death. York quickly reverted to Viking control under Olaf Guthfrithsson of Dublin. AEthelstan&apos;s successor, his half brother 
Eadmund, spent most of his reign attempting to maintain control of his threatened kingdom.

Parsons notes 10 moneyers, all at the London mint, who struck helmet types that had two crosses in the field, as here. Leofwold was not among 
them. As some of these moneyers were fairly prolific, the extreme rarity of these coins suggests the crosses were applied for a particular issue 
at London that was short in duration.

The location of the very rare mint &quot;Gothaburh,&quot; also cited as &quot;Castle Gotha,&quot; remains uncertain. Earlier authors placed it at Godalming in 
Surrey, Jedburg in Roxburghshire, Dewsbury in Yorkshire, Woodborough in Nottinghamshire, Idbury in Oxfordshire, or &quot;Ythanceaster&quot; in 
Essex, but none with conclusive evidence. Stylistic comparison by Dolley and Elmore-Jones with other last small cross issues reveal that the 
coins of this mint belong to the south-western group, suggesting a location somewhere in West Wessex. Furthermore, the moneyer Goda is 
known at the Devon mints of Lydford and Totnes.

This coin exhibits a number of unusual features to suggest it is an imitation: a schematized obverse type and legend, an absent reverse initial 
cross, an engraver&apos;s guidline along the reverse legend, and crudely engraved reverse letters. However, the Norwich mint issued notoriously 
crude pennies, with the official issues illustrated in Copenhagen showing only slightly better style than that seen on this piece.

Gaspar Fagel to the British People in Support of Religious Toleration under William of Orange. Of Dutch manufacture.

($1500) 

A Dutch statesman, writer, and sometime diplomat, Gaspar Fagel authored a series of letters for and on behalf of William III, Prince of Orange, 
during that ruler&apos;s campaign to take the English throne in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. The most famous of these letters, and the one 
commemorated by this medal, was a 1687 open letter to the British people (and a possible covert bid by the Prince of Orange to claim the 
throne), in response to the religious policy of James II and his trampling of English liberties. 

The obverse represents a Britain of religious toleration with the Anglican miter, Roman Catholic chalice, wafer, and rosary, and the Non 
conformist dove surrounding the free Bible in the center. The inscribed scroll refers to the engagement of the Scottish lawyer James Steward 
by James II to write letters to the Pensionary Fagel with a view to induce William and Mary to approve the abolition of the Test and Penal 
Laws. The hound on the reverse, a Dutch emblem of greed or lust, symbolizes James II devouring his coronation oath, trampling on the liberty 
of conscience, and removing the Test and Penal Laws, which sealed the safety of the state. 

1563. 
STUART (ORANGE). temp. William III. 1694-1702. AR Medal (43mm, 29.44 g, 12h). Assassination Plot Against

enclosure, the first two each holding sword, and together holding purse inscribed CM/PISTO (100,000 pistoles) in two lines; 
in foreground to right, the young pretender riding backwards upon a lobster; in the background, a group of armed men in a 
clearing, and a fleet of ships upon the sea on the horizon; GENESIS • XLIX • 5 • 6 • (Genesis 49:5-6) below; in three lines in 
exergue, ADVERS&apos; • GVLIELMVM • III/ANGLIAE REGEM •/3 • MART • 1696 • (against William III, the King of England, 
on the 3rd of March). MI 151/414; Eimer 369; Woolf 13:2; van Loon IV, p. 165. Good VF, toned. Rare. 
($1000) 

This medal presents an interesting allusion, comparing Louis and James to Herod and Pilate -united against a common enemy in the form of 
William III and the Church of England. Furthering the religious significance of this iconography is the reference to Acts 4:26, reading &apos;...the 
kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.&apos; On the reverse, the purse represents 
the funds necessary to conduct their insidious plot, and the reference to Genesis 49:5-6 likens the Catholic monarch and former-monarch to 
Simeon and Levi, the warlike sons of Jacob.

each, of which 283 of these were struck. Additionally, 50 were made in tin, 102 in silver, and only six in gold.
