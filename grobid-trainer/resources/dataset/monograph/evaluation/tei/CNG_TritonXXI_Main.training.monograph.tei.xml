AUCTION TERMS 

This is a public, mail bid, and internet auction conducted by Classical 
Numismatic Group, Inc. (CNG). Bidding in the auction constitutes 
acceptance of the following terms: 

1. 
The property listed in this catalogue is offered for sale by 
CNG for itself and as agent for various owners and other consignors. 
We reserve the right to reject any bid, to determine the opening price, 
to set bidding increments, to vary the order of the auction, to reopen 
bidding in the case of a dispute, to withdraw any lot, to bid on behalf 
of CNG, to bid on behalf of the consignor, to permit the auctioneer to 
bid on his own behalf, and to permit the consignor to bid on his own 
lots. CNG may loan or advance money to consignors or prospective 
bidders, and may have an interest other than commission charges in 
any lot. CNG may bid on its own account as an &quot;insider&quot; with infor-
mation not available to the public. 

2. 
A buyer&apos;s fee will be charged to all successful bidders as fol-
lows on the hammer price: 
A. 22.5% for written, fax, email, telephone, and live internet bids. 
B. 20% for floor bids placed in person at the auction and electronic 
bids placed directly on www.cngcoins.com. 
All written bids, email bids, non-live telephone bids, live internet bid 
registrations, and live telephone bid registrations must be received 
before 5PM Eastern time on the day before the auction begins. CNG 
reserves the right to change the format of www.cngcoins.com at any 
time. 

3. 
All coins are guaranteed genuine. Attribution, date, condi-
tion, and other descriptions are the opinion of the cataloguer, and no 
warranty is expressed or implied. Please note that an auction sale 
is not an approval sale. Lots examined prior to the sale and lots 
purchased by floor bidders (including bidders executing commission 
bids on behalf of other parties) may not be returned for any reason 
except lack of authenticity. All claims of misdescription and all 
claims of return, except claims regarding authenticity, must be made 
within 5 days of receipt of material. Any claim of lack of authenticity 
must be made in writing by the original purchaser immediately after 
discovery that an item is not authentic, and upon making such a claim 
the original purchaser must immediately return the lot to CNG in the 
same condition as at the time of the auction. Coins that have been 
encapsulated (&quot;slabbed&quot;) by a grading and/or authentication service 
may not be returned for any reason, including authenticity, if they 
have been removed from the encapsulation (&quot;slab&quot;). If payment is 
made by credit card, rights of return are governed by these Auction 
Terms which supercede any rights of return promulgated by the card 
issuer. Estimates are intended as a guide only and not as a statement 
of opinion of value. 

4. 
Invoices are due and payable immediately upon receipt. 
Interest and late fees of 2.0% per month, or at the highest rate permit-
ted by law, whichever is less, from the date of the auction, shall be 
payable on invoices not settled within 30 days of the auction date. 
Payment may be made by check or bank wire. Credit cards (Visa 
or MasterCard) will be accepted; credit card payments will not be 
accepted more than 14 days after the sale date. Payment by check 
must be made in either US dollars ($) drawn on a US bank or British 
sterling (£) drawn on a British bank. All successful bidders outside 
North America and the United Kingdom will be charged an additional 
$20 fee for bank charges that are the result of international wire trans-
fer fees; this fee will be deducted for credit card or check payment as 
described above. CNG may reduce or compromise any charge or fee 
at its discretion. 

5. 
Bidders not known to us must provide us with satisfactory 
credit references or pay a deposit as determined at CNG&apos;s discretion 
before bidding. Minors are not permitted to bid without written con-
sent of a parent guaranteeing payment. CNG may require payment 
in full from any bidder prior to delivery of lots. Title does not pass 
until lots are paid in full. Upon receipt of lots, the buyer assumes full 
responsibility for loss or damage. Delivery to the buyer&apos;s address of 
record shall constitute receipt by the buyer regardless of the identity 
of the person accepting delivery. 

6. 
Estimates are in U.S. dollars ($US) and bids must be in 
even dollar ($) amounts. CNG will execute mail bids on behalf of 
mail bidders. Subject to reserves and opening prices, mail bids will be 
executed at one bidding increment (approximately 10%) over the next 
highest bid. In the case of identical bids, the earliest bid wins. A mail 
bid has priority over an identical floor bid. Bid by lot number. No lots 
will be broken. Bidders are responsible for errors in bidding. Check 
your bid sheet carefully. 

7. 
All lots are subject to reserve unless otherwise indicated. 
However, no reserve will be higher than the estimate, and ordinarily 
lots are reserved at 60% of estimate. 

8. 
Bidders personally guarantee payment for their successful 
bids, including bidders executing commission bids from other parties 
and bidders representing corporations or other entities. Buyers accept-
ing commission bids from other parties do so at their own risk and 
remain responsible for payment under these Auction Terms. 

9. 
At the conclusion of bidding for each lot, the sale contract is 
concluded and the successful bidder becomes liable for immediate 
payment under these Auction Terms. In the event a successful bidder 
fails to make full payment within 30 days of the auction date, CNG 
reserves the right either: (a) to require payment as provided under 
these Auction Terms; or (b) to deem the sale incomplete and to re-auc-
tion the material, in which case the successful bidder agrees to pay for 
the reasonable cost of such a sale and also to pay any shortfall between 
the re-auction price and the successful bidder&apos;s purchase price. CNG 
reserves all rights that it is entitled to under the Pennsylvania Uniform 
Commercial Code, including the right to offset any sums due from a 
successful bidder against any future consignment or purchase or mon-
ies or goods in possession of CNG. 

10. 
Sales tax, postage, handling and insurance are the responsibil-
ity of the buyer and are added to all invoices where appropriate. For 
buyers in the European Union, CNG may import lots into the United 
Kingdom prior to shipment and charge buyers the import Value Added 
Tax. On any tax not paid by the purchaser which should have been 
paid, even if not invoiced by CNG, the purchaser agrees to pay the 
same on demand together with any interest or penalty that may be 
assessed. It is the responsibility of the buyer to comply with foreign 
customs and other regulations. 

11. 
Prices realized are published after the sale and are mailed with 
CNG&apos;s next publication. Prices realized are also posted after the sale 
on CNG&apos;s web site: www.cngcoins.com 

12. 
Bidders hereby waive any claim for incidental, consequential 
or exemplary damages arising from this auction. The sole remedy that 
any participant in the auction shall have for any claim or controversy 
arising out of the auction shall be a refund, without interest, of all or 
part of the purchase price paid by the participant. 

13. 
All rights granted by CNG or otherwise available to bidders 
and purchasers, under these Auction Terms or otherwise, are personal 
and may not be assigned or transferred to any other person or entity, 
whether by operation of law or otherwise. No third party may rely on 
any benefit or right conferred by these Auction Terms. Bidders acting 
as agents must disclose the agency in writing to CNG prior to the auc-
tion; otherwise rights are limited to the agent and are not transferable 
to the undisclosed principal. 

14. 
Any dispute regarding this auction shall be governed by the 
laws of Pennsylvania and shall be adjudicated only by the Lancaster 
County Court of Common Pleas or the U.S. District Court for the 
Eastern District of Pennsylvania; all bidders submit themselves to 
the personal jurisdiction of these courts for this purpose, consent 
to service of process by registered or certified mail, and waive any 
contrary provisions of Articles 14 or 15 of the French Civil Code and 
any similar provisions in any jurisdiction. All bidders consent to the 
confidentiality of consignors&apos; identities and waive any right to require 
disclosure of the name of the consignor or owner of any auction lot, 
whether such right is based on New York GOL  §5-701(a) or any other 
provision in any jurisdiction. In any dispute regarding this auction, the 
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and 
attorney fees.

Jonathan P. Rosen 

Jonathan P. Rosen received his first coin as a gift from his parents on his 10 th birthday -a Roman silver denarius 
of Claudius and Nero. From this beginning, his collecting continued uninterrupted, with his focus changing from 
Roman coins to British Commonwealth coinage while studying law in England, and then, after graduating from 
law school in 1970, to early electrum coins. He loaned portions of his electrum collection for an exhibition at the 
Getty and Brooklyn museums in the 1980s, accompanied by a catalog Jonathan co-wrote with Arthur Houghton. 
His collection of electrum coinage was the basis of his collection of early Greek coinage, published by the Ameri-
can Numismatic Society in 1983 as part of their Ancient Coins in North American Collections series (Early Greek 
Coins from the Collection of Jonathan P. Rosen by Nancy M. Waggoner). Today, Jonathan&apos;s coin collecting efforts 
are primarily focused on Kyzikos electrum staters and Hadrian&apos;s Travel Series. 

In addition to his lifelong passion for collecting coins, Jonathan is also an avid collector of ancient art, and he has 
assembled one of the world&apos;s most important private collections of Mesopotamian cylinder seals, many of which 
are on public display. Jonathan&apos;s wife, Jeannette, has steadfastly encouraged his interests over their many years of 
marriage. Together, they support many important cultural institutions including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 
the Brooklyn Museum, the Israel Museum, the Bible Lands Museum, the Morgan Library and Museum, and the 
Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University. 

Jonathan and Jeannette&apos;s son, Adam, is continuing the family tradition of collecting and philanthropy. He is a 
serious collector of ancient art and coinage, sharing his father&apos;s passion for Greek coins, especially electrum. At 
this year&apos;s American Numismatic Society Gala, the Rosen Family will receive the Trustees&apos; Award for 2018, the 
Society&apos;s singular honor. 

The present sale features an offering of Jonathan&apos;s British gold and silver coins and medals, as well as selections 
from his Roman and World gold coins.

Arthur M. Fitts III 

Arthur M. Fitts III was born in Framingham, Massachusetts, and start-
ed collecting coins as a young boy. He graduated from Harvard Uni-
versity in 1959, and then started teaching at an independent boarding 
school in Newton, Mass., where he established a coin club. He joined 
the Boston Numismatic Society and was the General Chairman of the 
American Numismatic Association&apos;s (ANA) annual convention held 
in Boston in 1973. 

In 1974, Arthur moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado to go to work 
for the ANA. He would serve as the ANA&apos;s museum curator, assis-
tant executive director, and convention director from 1974-78. 

Arthur&apos;s commitment to the ANA would continue as he served as an 
ANA governor (2001-2005), as moderator of the Maynard Sundman/ 
Littleton Coin Company Lecture Series (2008-11), and as an exhibit 
judge and a mentor for the ANA Numismatic Correspondence Course. 
He was also a regular columnist (&quot;Medieval Coins&quot;) and contributing 
editor for The Numismatist. 

Arthur is a three-time recipient of the ANA Presidential Award (1994, 
1998, 2009), and has received the Medal of Merit (1998), Glenn 
Smedley Memorial Award (2000), Lifetime Achievement Award 
(2001), Exemplary Service Award (2006), Adna G. Wilde Jr. Memo-
rial Award for Excellence (2010), and the ANA&apos;s highest honor, the 
Farran Zerbe Award (2012). This last award he shared with his wife, 
Prue Morgan Fitts, also a noted collector and numismatist. 

One of the foremost numismatic couples in the U.S., both Arthur and Prue were regular instructors for many 
years at the annual ANA Summer Seminar held in Colorado Springs. Arthur is a noted expert on English coins, 
British medals, and other series, while Prue concentrates on Byzantine coinage. 

In addition to his volunteer work for the ANA, Arthur was an appointee to the United States Assay Commission 
in 1975. He served as executive secretary of the Old Timer Assay Commissioner Society from 2003-2012, and is 
a former president (1982-95) and secretary (1978-81, 1995-99) of the Boston Numismatic Society. Arthur is also 
a member of the British Numismatic Society, and a Fellow of the American Numismatic Society and the Royal 
Numismatic Society. 

We would like to dedicate this catalogue to Dale Tatro, 
our recently retired colleague and friend, 
and acknowledge her dedicated efforts to the 
success of this company over the last fifteen years. 
Thank you Dale, and enjoy your retirement 
and spending time with your grandchildren!

By the mid-fourth century BC, a flood of Italic peoples -Samnites, Brettii, and Lucani -had been pressing the Greek city-states of Magna 
Graecia for decades. In desperation, the Tarentines turned to the king of Epeiros, Alexander the Molossian. Alexander, while eager to help his 
Greek brothers, remained aware of the opportunity to add to his holdings and emulate his Macedonian cousin, Alexander the Great. Though 
initially defeating the Samnites and Lucani in battle, the fortunes of the Epirote king met a dramatic reversal at the Battle of Pandosia, when 
Alexander was slain by a Lucanian javelin. The exquisite gold staters of the present type were struck to finance these campaigns.

Demonstrating the usual flare shown by the die engravers in the service of Pyrrhos during his military expedition in Italy and Sicily, the small 
gold issues of 280/279 BC, depicting Nike and Leukippos (HN Italy 1629-1631), are of a refinement second to none. The traditional city 
founder is rendered in exquisite detail with the added novelty of his helmet being decorated with Skylla hurling a stone, the very embodiment 
of aggressive violence before the enemy in time of war.

This magnificent tetradrachm is from a series at Rhegion that is regarded as having the most finely engraved dies of all the numismatic output 
of the mint. The earliest phase features dies signed by the artist Kratesippos, but the later unsigned dies, such as were used here, are regarded 
as the pinnacle of this period at Rhegion. Herzfelder called the engraver of these dies &quot;the Master of the Rhegium Apollo.&quot; While the style 
of Apollo on these dies was conventionally considered to have been influenced by the &quot;Master of the Leaf&quot; of the slightly earlier issues of 
Katane, R.R. Holloway suggests that there was actually a common prototype for both issues, which served as a model for coinages as far away 
as the Chalkidian League. This high period of artistry at Rhegion coincides with the famed issues of the &quot;signing artists&quot; of Sicily, and was 
only brought to a conclusion with the sack of the city by Dionysios I of Syracuse in 386 BC.

This coin is a true enigma. As an anepigraphic issue, one must look to other aspects of the coin for attribution, but the types here are rather 
ubiquitous, and the physical aspects of the piece do not suggest even a particular region. Clain-Stefanelli apparently attributed the coin to 
Bruttium during the Pyrrhic Wars, but without her reasoning, it can only be regarded as speculative. Teanum Sidicinum in Campania struck an 
issue of nomoi with a head of Herakles and club on the obverse, and Nike in a chariot on the reverse, but the style of this issue seems foreign 
to that city, and its weight is too low without any significant wear. With the lack of information regarding its discovery, the attribution of this 
issue remains a mystery. 

Previously Unknown Alliance 

330. 
BRUTTIUM and SICILY, Rhegion and Akragas. Joint issue, circa 480-474 or 463/2-462/1 BC. AR Litra(?) (9mm, 
0.52 g, 9h). Eagle standing right on basis; åkR-Å around; all within dotted border / RE1 within dotted border. Unpublished, 
but see Caltabiano 114 for this reverse die used on a standard litra of Rhegion. Good VF, toned, light porosity, die break on 
reverse. 
($1500) 

The historical record notes various alliances by each of these cities, but not with each other. The types here date the coinage to the early or 
mid 5th century, and although the history of each city is well known for that period, there is no common event that involved each of them. As 
such, this coin presently represents the only historical evidence of any sort of alliance between these two significant cities. The dates of issue 
are based on Caltabiano for this reverse die.

In the final decade of the fifth century BC, the Carthaginians launched a series of invasions of Sicily, conquering much of the western half of 
the island and bringing devastation to many formerly flourishing Greek communities. The Punic presence lasted for a century and a half, until 
Rome&apos;s victory in the First Punic War obliged the Carthaginians to withdraw. During their time of occupation, the Carthaginians struck an 
extensive coinage in Sicily for the purpose of financing their military operations and the maintenance of garrisons. The obverse and reverse 
types of the series are mostly influenced by Sicilian prototypes, particularly those of Syracuse, except for the later series with the head of 
Herakles on the obverse, which was obviously influenced by the well-recognized coinage of Alexander the Great. While a few of the series 
are struck at cities with established mints, such as Motya and Panormos, these are often viewed as minor or campaign mints that operated for a 
short duration. The location of the primary Punic mint (or mints) on Sicily, responsible for the large issues studied by G.K. Jenkins (&apos;Carthage&apos; 
series I-V), has been the subject of great debate. Most recently, I. Lee surveyed the existing literature and took a fresh look at the full spectrum 
of evidence, persuasively concluding that this mint was located at Entella (&quot;Entella: The Silver Coinage of the Campanian Mercenaries and 
the First Carthaginian Mint 410-409 BC&quot; in NC 160 [2000], pp. 1-66).

Dionysios assumed power in 405 BC and immediately set out to make Syracuse the greatest and best fortified city in all of Greece. He was 
defending against the renewed imperialistic expansion of Carthage. Three times he defeated the Carthaginians, bringing further prestige and 
wealth to Syracuse. During his reign, the Syracuse navy became the most powerful in the Mediterranean, allowing Syracuse to expand her 
control over much of the southern Italian coast. 

Dionysios reintroduced the large and ostentatious silver dekadrachms, a denomination that had not been used in Syracuse since the Demareteion 
issue decades earlier. Dionysios entrusted two of the greatest local engravers, Kimon and Euainetos, to design these impressive pieces. The 
regard for these coins in modern times is reflected by the fact that they are considered a must for any first rank collection of Greek coins.

Although since the late 6th century BC relations between Rome and Carthage had always been maintained on a friendly basis, Rome&apos;s 
growing influence in Magna Graecia in the early decades of the third century BC led inevitably to an increasing rivalry between the two 
powers. The Italian state was being drawn inexorably into the bitter politics of the centuries-old dispute between Greeks and Carthaginians 
in Sicily. This magnificent medallic piece was issued at about the time of the outbreak of the First Punic War which, after almost a quarter of 
a century of fighting, was to bring about the end of the Carthaginian presence on the island. Find spots for these coins have been exclusively 
Sicilian, and they were presumably struck for military purposes. Although horses had always been popular on Carthaginian and Siculo-
Punic issues, the depiction of the winged Pegasos represented a departure from tradition. The influence of the Corinthian coinage and that of 
her colony Syracuse seems obvious. The typically enigmatic Punic inscription translates &quot;in the land,&quot; and the Carthaginian stronghold of 
Panormos on the north coast of western Sicily has been suggested as the mint for this impressive series.

No staters are listed in the standard references for Lysimachos from the mint of Amphipolis. The earliest sources, Müller, de Luynes, and 
Anadol, attributed this issue to Ainos, while the BM database places it at Amphipolis. The style of the portrait is extremely similar to 
Lysimachos&apos; tetradrachms struck at Amphipolis that have, as here, the kerykeion symbol in the inner left field (Thompson 188-91). Also, this 
particular monogram was used on issues of Demetrios Poliorketes at Amphipolis (Newell 123-4) shortly after the end of Lysimachos&apos; reign. 
Surely, this issue must be from Amphipolis, rather than Ainos. 

There actually may only be five examples previously published, since the BM piece was acquired from the collection of Grand Duke Alexandre 
Michaïlovitch (via Archer Huntington), who may have acquired one of the two Anadol pieces.

The Bisaltai were a tribe of Pelasgian or Thracian origin and occupied the territory between the rivers Echedoros and Strymon, including 
the metalliferous mountains, which separate the territory of the Bisaltai from the territory of the Krestonioi and Mygonia on the west (Hdt. 
7.115). At the time of the invasion of Xerxes in 480 BC, the Bisaltai were governed by a Thracian ruler who was independent of Macedonian 
influence, and refused to assist the Great King of Persia when his army crossed Thrace to invade mainland Greece. At some point after the 
Persian retreat, Alexander I of Macedon, who was in the service of Persians as early as 492 BC, annexed the territory as far as the Strymon 
Valley. Capturing its rich silver mines, he issued the first regal Macedonian coinage, which is indistinguishable from the Bisaltian but for the 
placing of his own name. The absence of Bisaltai oktadrachms in the Asyut hoard led Price and Waggoner to suggest a mintage date of circa 
475-465 BC. This coinage was terminated about the same time as the disaster at Drabeskos in 465/4 BC, in which the Athenian colonists of 
Ennea Hodoi (later Amphipolis) were exterminated by the native Thracians, though it is unknown whether this coinage is directly related to 
the Bisaltai&apos;s involvement in this conflict.

The coins of Smith&apos;s Group 9 are among the rarest of the entire series of Siris. Unlike the other groups, where the satyr is confronting the 
nymph, here the satyr is actively chasing the nymph. Both figures have their arms positioned as if sprinting, and are depicted in naturalistic 
postures. It almost appears as though the scene were being viewed with a stop-motion camera.

Aineia (mod. Nea Michaniona) was located on the north-east coast of the Chalkidike. It was a comparatively obscure place in ancient times, 
occupied from the Archaic through the Hellenistic periods. Some fine burial mounds from the city have produced gold treasures, and the city 
is attested in Athenian fiscal documents. According to legend it was founded by Trojans, who named it after the famous Trojan hero, Aineias 
(Aeneas). 

The occasion for the issue of this impressive silver tetradrachm is not known, though by its style and fabric it can be dated to the middle of 
the fourth century BC. Its designs were clearly inspired by existing Greek coin types, though it does distinguish itself with some local flare. 
The head of the nymph on the obverse, wreathed in grain, may be based upon the prolific issues of staters of Opuntian Lokris, which often 
circulated in northern Greece. However, the artist may have also been influenced by the same prototype that inspired engravers throughout the 
Greek world in the 4th century, the head of Arethousa on the famed Syracusan dekadrachms of Euainetos. The reverse is perhaps inspired by 
the standard issues of Ainos, which also featured a lone standing animal, albeit a goat.

Although this type is unpublished in specialized references, see McClean 7312 for a hemiobol with the same obverse type, and a reverse with 
K-A flanking a grape bunch that E.S.G. Robinson attributed to Kapsa. The Hermes and wine related types are, individually, quite common in 
the Thraco-Macedonian region, but, except for this coin and the McClean hemiobol, are not found together. Epigraphically, it is attractive to 
suggest an attribution to Kallatis or Kabyle, where Hermes is often used on bronze coins, but wine related types are not found on the coins 
of either city. On the other hand, the city of Kapsa is thought to have been located north of Mende on the Thermaic gulf (Hdt. 7.123), an area 
well known for its wine production -wine motifs figure prominently on the coinage of Mende, as well as other cities in the Chalkidike. The 
combination of Hermes with wine also has a Dionysiac reference -while an infant, Dionysos was given into the charge of Hermes by Zeus. 
Motifs associated with Dionysos are also prominently displayed on coins in the Chalkidike. The association of the Hermes and the wine-
related types with Dionysos also serves as a link between these coins and the mule/incuse coinage attributed to Kapsa, which have a KA 
inscribed on their reverses (cf. SNG ANS 228; Traité I 1628). In sum, the combination of these types and the legend KA strongly suggest that 
Robinson&apos;s attribution of these later issues to Kapsa is correct.

The city of Mende, located on the Pallene Peninsula on the eastern shore of the Thermaic Gulf was, according to Thucydides (4.123.1), 
founded by Eretria in the 8th century. It later founded colonies of its own: Neapolis on the eastern coast of Pallene, and Eion at the mouth of 
the river Strymon near Amphipols. Mende&apos;s wealth is indicated by the high amounts of tribute paid to the Delian Confederacy: eight talents 
until 451-450 BC, and then amounts ranging form five to nine talents after 438-437 BC. During the Peloponnesian War (431-404 BC) Mende 
originally sided with Athens, but then, on the urging of the oligarchs, went over to the Spartan general Brasidas. It eventually returned to the 
Athenian side, but is not mentioned in connection with the Peace of Nicias. From 415-414 BC Mende again appears in the Athenian Tribute 
Lists, but by the fourth century the city was only minting copper coins.The Dionysiac types of Mende proclaim it as a famous wine producing 
city, as attested by its amphoras that have been found throughout the Mediterranean. On this delightful coin Dionysos, who rules wine and 
winemaking, is shown being carried home drunken from a symposium, a type of careless joy which links the world of men with the Olympians 
-at least until the morning.

In his famous work on Greek coinage, with its wonderful illustrations by Max Hirmer, Colin Kraay called this issue &quot;[t]he most remarkable&quot; 
of the early coinage of the Chalkidike. These tetradrachms depict the hero Protesilaos, the legendary founder of Skione, who is better known 
from his role in the Iliad. 

One of Helen&apos;s numerous suitors, Protesilaos was the first of the Greek heroes to arrive in the Troad -and the first to die. According to 
Hyginus (Fabulae 103), an oracle declared that the first Greek to walk upon the land after departing his ship to fight the Trojans would be the 
first to die. Upon leaping from his ship onto the shore, he was slain by the Trojan hero, Hektor, although some ancient sources dispute this. At 
Skione, Protesilaos is reported to have had a founder-cult. According to the Augustan era mythographer Konon (FGrHist 133a3), Protesilaos 
survived the Trojan War. Returning home with Aithilla, the sister of Priam, he and his men were forced to found the future Skione, when they 
were stranded there after Aithilla and the other Trojan women burned the ships. That Protesilaos was closely associated with Skione (and thus 
the inspiration for Konon&apos;s story) since the Classical period, is clear from this rare tetradrachm, which identifies Protesilaos on the obverse.

($1000) 

The control marks suggest a Seleukid issue from Susa (cf. SC 164 Group 1), but the style here is too far from the norm at that mint. The 
style closely resembles the rare pre-Seleukid tetradrachm issue at Ekbatana (Price 3956), as well as the earliest issues struck under Seleukos 
I (SC 202.1-2). As the control marks for Ekbatana under the Seleukids are well attested, and do not resemble those on the present piece, this 
tetradrachm is likely from the pre-Seleukid period of the mint.

($2000) 

This issue of drachms is among the rarest of Leukas&apos; coinage. Only five magistrates are known: Damokrates, Damylos, Dion, Lysimachos, 
and Nikoboulos. Of the major public published collections, only the BM and Copenhagen have any in their holdings, a single drachm each, 
of Damylos and Lysimachos, respectively. The sole published example of a drachm of Nikoboulos was in P. Lambros&apos; collection, published 
by A. Postolakas in 1868 (presumably now in the Numismatic Museum, Athens). CoinArchives contains only one drachm, of the magistrate 
Damokrates. Perhaps most telling of the rarity of the issue is that not one drachm from any of these magistrates was present in the BCD 
Collection.

From the BCD catalog: &quot;The engraver who cut the obverse die for this coin may well have been the same who did those for the Arkadian 
League, since some of those dies are nearly identical to this one (see, especially, BMC 48; but also Boston MFA 1260 and Käppeli 85). The 
thunderbolt behind Zeus&apos; head is probably not a magistrate&apos;s symbol as some have supposed, but simply a reference to Zeus himself. The 
difference in conception between this head and [those on other issues] is quite massive. This is the most elegant, late Classical head of Zeus to 
appear on the coins of Olympia, and is reminiscent of, but far finer, than any of the best issues of Philip II. Coins like this make it abundantly 
clear that the Eleans saw the coins of Olympia as prestige issues, and that they were fully willing to pay for the best engravers in the Greek 
world to produce them.&quot;

($40,000) 

Pantikapaion was founded by Greek colonists from Miletos in the late seventh century BC. Situated on the west side of the Cimmerian 
Bosporos, in what is now called the Crimea, it achieved great prosperity through its exploitation of the abundant fisheries of the straits and the 
export of wheat from the Crimea. This wealth is attested by its splendid gold coinage, which commenced in the mid-4th century BC, and by 
the magnificently furnished rock tombs of its principal citizens in the same period. Later, it was to become a regional capital of the kingdom 
of Mithradates VI of Pontos (120-63 BC) and later still the seat of the kings of Bosporos (first century BC -fourth century AD). The coinage 
of Pantikapaion seems to have commenced with silver issues in the latter part of the fifth century BC, but it is for its beautiful gold staters that 
the mint is chiefly noted. They depict the head of the god Pan (a pun on the name of the city) and on the reverse the griffin that Herodotos 
describes as being the guardian of the remote sources of gold.

Pharnakes was awarded the Bosporan Kingdom by Pompey, for the betrayal of his father Mithradates VI, King of Pontos. Little is known 
of his 16-year reign except for its ending. During the Civil War between Pompey and Julius Caesar, Pharnakes tried to recapture his father&apos;s 
former territories in Pontos. He won a victory over Caesar&apos;s general, Domitius Calvinus, and ordered Romans in the region castrated or put to 
the sword. In response, Caesar launched a rapid five day war against Pharnakes in 47 BC, culminating in the battle of Zela. Caesar emerged 
victorious, prompting him to report back to the Senate with the now famous dictum, &quot;Veni, Vidi, Vici&quot; (I came, I saw, I conquered).

Mithradates is the Hellenistic monarch par excellence, his career driven by megalomaniacal ambitions leading to murderous assaults upon 
family and followers and disastrous foreign adventures against superior forces. His idealized portraiture attempts to mimic the gods with its 
bold staring gaze and unruly, free-flowing hair, but at its most extreme is a personification of hysteria in its Dionysiac sense. The wreath of ivy 
on the reverse reinforces Mithradates&apos; link with the god as well as making a connection with the cistophoric coinage that circulated in the area. 
The stag probably represents the civic center of Ephesos and the mintmark is of Pergamon, all part of the new Pontic kingdom, symbolized 
by the star and crescent. His empire collapsed before the armies of Sulla and Lucullus, and Mithradates ended his own life in exile in the far 
region of the Crimea, pursued to the end by vengeful Romans and family.

The historical record of Prousias I begins well into his reign, in 220 BC, when he defeated the forces of Byzantion, capturing their territories 
on the Asian side of the Thracian Bosporos; all the while his enemies, Attalos I of Pergamon and Adaios, the Seleukid general in Thrace, were 
supporting Prousias&apos; uncle as an usurper to his kingdom. Subsequently, circa 218 BC, Attalos encouraged the Galatians, who had previously 
murdered Prousias&apos; father, Ziaëlas, to invade Bithynia in order to weaken Prousias&apos; position, but they were decisively defeated. Prousias then 
allied with Philip V of Macedon during the First Macedonian War (214-205 BC), and attacked the territories of Attalos I, forcing the latter 
to withdraw his support from the Romans. In the aftermath of that conflict, Philip and Prousias jointly campaigned against Pergamon in the 
First Cretan War (205-200 BC). During the confilct, the Pergamene-controlled cities of Kios and Myrleia were destroyed, and upon their ruins 
Prousias founded the cities of Prousias by the Sea and Apameia, respectively. Over the next 12 years, Prousias stayed out of the region&apos;s major 
conflicts, until a territorial dispute led to renewed conflict between the Attalids and Bithynians (187-183 BC). During this conflict, Prousias 
gave the famous Carthaginian general, Hannibal, asylum, for which the latter served as a military advisor to the Bithynian king. At the same 
time, Prousias expanded his kingdom by attacking the territory of Herakleia Pontike, but this venture came to a premature end when Prousias 
was injured in battle. This injury lead to his epithet, Cholos (&quot;the lame&quot;). In 183 BC, the Attalid king, Eumenes II, decisively defeated the 
Bithynians, forcing Prousias to give up his territories in Phrygia and turn over Hannibal to the Romans (an event that the Carthaginian escaped 
by committing suicide). Prousias died the following year.

The identification of the male on the obverse has long been debated. M. F. Lenormant first suggested Phrixos sacrificing the ram with the 
golden fleece, but Greenwell preferred Odysseus slaying the animal Circe provided him before his descent into Hades, in part due to the figure 
being bearded, which indicated an older individual, which contrasts with the youthful portraits traditionally given to Phrixos.

Parallels have been drawn between the obverse of this type with the facing head Apollo on the famous &apos;Parthenon Group&apos; tetradrachms of 
Amphipolis. As the present coinage was struck decades prior to that of Amphipolis, one wonders whether this issue of Mytilene influenced 
the masterful artists of the Macedonian city.

Pompeius Macer 
Confirming a Suspected Identification 

475. 
IONIA, Priene. M. Pompeius Macer. Procurator of Asia, temp. Augustus, 27 BC-AD 14. AE (12mm, 1.71 g, 12h). 
ΠOM[ΠEI]-OΣ MAKЄP, bare head of Macer right / ΠPIHNЄΩN, Bias standing left; tripod to right. Stumpf 161 = Regling 
186 = FITA 388 = Waddington 1928 = RPC I 2687 (same dies). VF, dark earthen green patina. Extremely rare, one listed in 
RPC and a second in supplement (in Paris and Oxford, respectively). Apparently the third known and the only example in 
private hands. 
($1000) 

There has been some debate about the identity of the figure on the obverse, as the left hand portions of the Paris and Oxford specimens are 
illegible (others have suggested the portrait is of Clodius Macer or Aemilius Macer). The obverse legend on the current specimen clearly 
begins ΠOM..., thus leaving no doubt that the portrait is of Pompeius Macer. 

Strabo (Geog. 13.2.3) mentions a Marcus Pompeius, the son of a Mytilenean aristocrat named Theophanes, who was appointed procurator 
of Asia by Augustus, and who was &quot;counted among the first of the friends of Tiberius.&quot; Although it is not entirely certain, this figure has 
traditionally been identified with the Pompeius Macer, who was a close friend of the poet Ovid (Pont. 2.10) and whom Augustus appointed 
to organize his library (Suetonius 56.7).

The Beginnings of Coinage 

476. 
IONIA, Uncertain. Circa 650-600 BC. EL Trite -Third Stater (12mm, 4.63 g). Lydo-Milesian standard. Plain 
globular surface / Two incuse squares. Cf. Weidauer Group II (unlisted denomination); Karwiese, Artemision, Type I.1;

($3000) 

Other than the literary tradition ascribing the origin of coinage to the kings of Lydia, there is little evidence for a more exact chronology of 
early Greek coinage. The tradition, buttressed by limited archaeological studies, does confirm Asia Minor as the place of origin, most likely 
Lydia or Ionia, and a date somewhere around 650-625 BC. The alloy used was a mixture of gold and silver known to the Greeks as elektron. 
Although ancient sources indicated that this alloy was a natural ore found in nugget form in many riverbeds in the region, recent studies 
have concluded that this was actually not the case, and that the electrum used in coinage was, in fact, man-made. The earliest coins were 
of a globular shape and without design; later, simple striated and punched patterns of squares, rectangles, and swastikas were included. The 
earliest true types may have developed from the use of personal seals, the most widely known being the stater of Ephesos with a stag bearing 
the inscription &quot;I am a seal of Phanes&quot;. These devices later took on the characteristics of civic symbols, although it would be dangerous to link 
a specific symbol to a particular city in this early period. The most secure form of classification has been by weight standard, based on two 
major, and several lesser-used, standards. The Milesian standard, with a stater of roughly 14 grams, saw circulation in Lydia and parts of Ionia. 
The Phokaic standard of roughly 16 grams was also used in Ionia as well as Mysia. Persic, Aeginetan, and Euboic standards saw scattered 
use in early coinage, limited in time and extent of circulation. The intrinsic value of the early electrum, even down to the 1/96 stater, was too 
high for use in everyday commerce, and early coinage must have been used only for the transfer of large sums of money, such as mercantile 
transactions, payment of government expenses (mercenaries, tribute and such), and donatives, either for services rendered to individuals or 
the state, or to religious foundations. The Artemision deposits, hoards of early electrum found at the site of the temple of Artemis at Ephesos, 
are examples of the latter.

Good VF, light marks. Rare. 
($30,000) 

The &apos;Kroisos&apos; type coinage is one of the most recognizable of all ancient Greek coinage. All of the issues in the bimetallic, gold and silver, 
series feature the same confronted lion and bull foreparts on the obverse, and two incuse punches (or a single punch in the case of small 
denominations) on the reverse. The series began on a &apos;heavy&apos; standard, with gold and silver staters of equal weight, around 10.6-10.7 grams, 
which was later reduced to about 8.17 grams for the gold. Recent studies have shown that coins of both standards circulated together, but that 
the heavy standard was only used for a relatively short time compared to the light standard, which continued to be used into the Persian period. 
The Kroiseids have also traditionally been broken down into two stylistic groups, &apos;realistic&apos; and &apos;stylized&apos;, with hoard evidence suggesting 
that the former belonged to the time of Kroisos, while the latter were of the time of the Persians. The present coin, however, is from an issue 
that constitutes a third group that has a more archaic style, which has features that suggest it is the first issue of Kroisos&apos; bimetallic coinage. 

This prototype issue was first noted and analyzed in an article by Paolo Naster in 1964 (&quot;Une série aberrante de Créséides&quot; in BSFN 19 
(1964), pp. 364-5, reprinted in P. Naster, Scripta Nummaria: Contributions à la méthodologie numismatique [Louvian-la-Neuve, 1983], pp. 
76-7). The archaic character of the type is most evident in the bull, where the fine waves of hair on the later coinage are here represented as 
a series of pelleted lines emanating from a solid arc that forms the animal&apos;s neckline. At the same time, antecedents of the style of the lion 
can be seen in the earlier electrum coinage, particularly the hemihektai of Weidauer&apos;s Group XVI. The most significant feature linking this 
issue to the electrum, though, is the appearance of the small pellet or protuberance on the head of the lion. This feature, usually featuring rays 
emanating from it, is canonical on all the earlier electrum coinage from the time of Ardys until the early part of Kroisos&apos; reign. It is a feature 
that is totally lacking on the bimetallic coinage of the &apos;realistic&apos; and, later, &apos;stylized&apos; character. A final unusual feature particular to this issue 
is the depiction of the arms of the lion and bull, which are shown bent nearly 90 degrees at their midpoint, rather than in a straight line from 
shoulder to paw and hoof. 

The rarity today of these early style staters also suggests that the issue was short-lived, perhaps a trial run before the style was standardized. 
Martin Price also studied this unusual emission of staters (&quot;Croesus or Pseudo-Croesus?&quot; in Festschrift Mildenberg, p. 221, n. 25), and, like 
Naster, placed them between the electrum and the gold of standard style.

political ranks by ingratiating himself with various emperors. He held the consulship twice and is best known today for his prosecution of 
Thrasea Paetus, a critic of the emperor Nero. In AD 79, Marcellus committed suicide after being found guilty of participating in a plot against

The walking-lion series of Mazaios had originally been attributed to the mint of Tarsos, but Newell argued that they more likely were struck 
at Myriandros in his study of that mint in AJN 53 (1919). Later, J.D. Bing, in AJN 1 (1989), argued for an alternative attribution of the 
Myriandros coinage to the mint of Issos. While most numismatic works continue to follow Newell, Casabonne&apos;s significant study of Cilicia 
during the Persian period convincingly returns these coins of Mazaios to the mint of Tarsos (cf. Casabonne, pp. 215-7). 

The appearance of Baaltars on this issue is significantly different from the relatively standard depiction of the deity on other coins of Tarsos. 
While the deity is typically shown nude to his waist, here the figure is fully clothed with attire that closely resembles that on the figure that 
appears on the royal Persian coinage struck at Sardes. More important, though, is the headdress on the figure. Baaltars typically wears a laurel 
wreath or no headdress, while this portrait shows the figure wearing an elaborate headdress. In a recent article, Frank Kovacs analyzed the 
type, and argues that this figure is actually the Great King Araxeres III Ochos, in the guise of Baaltars, and the headdress is the combined 
crown of Upper and Lower Egypt, thus his appearance here is as pharaoh of Egypt (cf. F. Kovacs, &quot;Two Persian Pharaonic Portraits&quot; in JNG L 
[2000]; see also M. Thompson, in MN XII [1968], pp. 11-2, who notes the figure wearing a &quot;high crown of Egyptian type&quot;). This is plausible, 
as Araxerxes was the first pharaoh of the Thirty-First Dynasty of Egypt, and the date of his rule there, 343-338 BC, comports well with this 
issue under Mazaios. 

O. Casabonne, while acknowledging that the figure here may represent a synthesis of Baaltars and the Great King, disagrees with the 
identification of the headdress as the Egyptian crown. Instead, he views the headdress as being a Phrygian style cap that is often depicted 
in contemporary art as being worn by warriors (cf. Casabonne, p. 121, fig. 8), but is here shown with the cheek guards in a raised position.

($7500) 

Aristoboulos was the son of Herod of Chalkis and the great-grandson of Herod the Great. Josephus serves as our only literary source for 
the reign of Aristoboulos, informing us that he was appointed king of Armenia Minor by Nero in AD 54 (Ant. XX.158). He married Salome 
(daughter of Herod II and widow of Philip the Tetrarch), who has traditionally been identified as the young woman who demanded the head 
of John the Baptist (Matthew 14:1-12; Mark 6:14-29). Aristoboulos&apos; long reign would suggest he was a loyal client of Rome, as does the 
evidence we can glean from his coinage. 

Interestingly, coins of Aristoboulos were only struck for regnal years 13 and 17 (AD 66/7 and AD 70/1), which coincide with the outbreak and 
conclusion of the Jewish War. This seems to indicate that Aristoboulos&apos; coins were issued in the context of the revolt as a way for the Herodian 
ruler to reaffirm his faithfulness to Rome. Although Vespasian was emperor at the time this coin was issued, the reverse refers to Titus, who 
successfully suppressed the revolt in Judaea.

finest, known, one of which is in a public collection (Jerusalem). 
($500,000) 

From an American collection. 

This is one of three known examples of a prototype for the shekel of the first year of the Jewish War, beginning May 66 (or a bit later), and it is 
therefore the first coin type of the renowned Jewish War shekels and half shekels. One specimen, discussed further below, is in the collection of 
the Israel Museum, Jerusalem. The second specimen was sold in Shoshana I at a hammer of $925,000; the same coin had been sold previously 
in 1991 as part of the Bromberg Collection, and sold there for $242,000. 

This third specimen is the only one of the three that has not been cleaned, and it retains a thin, attractive patina of the silver chlorides typically 
seen on the Jewish shekels. It is also the best struck of the three coins, while all three of them are slightly off-center on the reverse, this 
specimen shows more of the legend than the others. 

In the late 1970&apos;s, Shab&apos;an Wazwaz, a dealer in Old City Jerusalem, offered me a group of six shekels. Three were year 2, two were year 3, 
and the sixth coin was the first known example of this type: Asking price was $6,000. Mr. Wazwaz was a legitimate dealer, but did have the 
reputation of selling the occasional forgery, and so I rejected the deal and instead offered $4,000 for the five shekels, not including the sixth. 
At the time, this type had not been published, and Ya&apos;akov Meshorer had seen the coin and said he believed it was not genuine. I was unable to 
discuss it with Meshorer, because he was not in the country during my visit. I was a &quot;kid&quot; only 10 years into my study, and it looked authentic 
to me, but I was in no position to put up $2,000 for a questionable coin. Upon his return from abroad, Meshorer reviewed the coin again and 
decided to buy it for the collection of the Israel Museum, where he was chief curator of archaeology as well as numismatics.

Extremely Rare Obodas I Drachm 

526. 
NABATAEA. Obodas I. Circa 96-86 BC. AR Drachm (16mm, 3.47 g, 1h). Ptolemaic standard. Petra mint(?). Dated 
RY 11 (86 BC). Diademed and draped bust right / ∫Å%5¬EW% o∫odÅ, eagle standing left on thunderbolt; l5Å (date) to left. 
Unpublished. Good VF, dark find patina. Extremely rare, one of two known (the other is unpublished). 
($15,000) 

This extremely rare Nabataean drachm, one of two examples known, raises several questions. The first is the identity of the &quot;Obodas&quot; named 
as the issuer. Traditionally, three Nabataean kings are thought to have been named Obodas: Obodas I (circa 96-86 BC), Obodas II (62-60 BC), 
and Obodas III (30-9 BC). This chronology had remained unquestioned among scholars, even as recently as 2002 when Jane Taylor (p. 219) 
published her Petra and the Lost Kingdom of the Nabataeans. In 2010, however, Martin Huth (&quot;Some Nabataean Questions Reconsidered,&quot; in 
Coinage of the Caravan Kingdoms, pp. 215-7), argued convincingly that only two kings of that name existed, thus removing the previously-
named Obodas II from the list of monarchs. This chronological reassessment is a critical element in securing the proper attribution of this 
drachm. 

Although the coins of Obodas II are relatively common, no coins have previously been assigned to Obodas I. The present coin is distinct in 
several respects from the coinage of Obodas II and almost certainly belongs to Obodas I. The fine Hellenistic style of the present coin is quite 
different from the many issues of Obodas II. The legend is in Greek rather than Aramaic. The weight is based on the Ptolemaic standard, unlike 
the coins of Obodas II, which are struck on the Phoenician standard. The form of the regnal date is likewise based on Ptolemaic practice. 

Furthermore, the reverse type of our coin would be entirely inappropriate for Obodas II (30-9 BC), considering the historical context of 
Obodas II&apos;s reign. Under Malichus I (59-30 BC), the Nabataeans sided with Antony and Cleopatra against Herod I, defeating Herod in 32 
BC at the Battle of Qanata. The following year, however, Nabataean fortunes changed; they were defeated by Herod of Judaea, and then 
the Nabataeans&apos; main allies Antony and Cleopatra were defeated at Actium. Following these defeats, the Nabataean kingdom under Obodas 
II became a client-state of Rome. The reverse of this drachm, with the eagle standing on a thunderbolt, is a recognizable &quot;Egyptian&quot; type, 
which, along with the Egyptian style date (LIA), would have recalled the alliance between the Nabataeans and the Ptolemaic kingdom under 
Cleopatra. For a Roman client-king to strike such a coin would have invited a crushing rebuke from his new Roman overlord. Yet, there is no 
evidence of this, and Obodas II appears to have enjoyed a long 21-year reign. 

All the evidence thus supports the attribution of this coin to Obodas I (circa 96-86 BC), and this coin of Regnal Year 11 should equate to 
the last year of his reign. Josephus (BJ 1.4.4) tells us that Obodas defeated the Hasmoneans, subsequently ambushing Alexander Jannaios 
(Yehonatan) near Gadara in revenge for the Nabataean loss of Gaza. In 86 BC, Obodas defeated the Seleukids at the Battle of Cana, at which 
Antiochos XII Dionysos was killed, and the Nabataeans conquered Damaskos, thereby increasing their power in the region. As a result, 
Obodas was venerated by the Nabataeans as a god and deified after his death, because he had defeated both the Hasmoneans and the Seleukids. 
This drachm was perhaps struck as a celebratory issue in the aftermath of Obodas&apos; victory over the Seleukids, as the regnal date likely equates 
to the same year as this event.

This issue was once thought to originate in northwest India, but more recent studies have conclusively placed it at an uncertain mint in 
Mesopotamia/northern Babylonia. The style and fabric of the coins are identical to the numerous imitations of Athens tetradrachms found in 
the latter region, as well as the imitations of Cilician staters found there that are attributed to the early Alexandrine period in Persia.

($50,000) 

Ex Vinchon (13 April 1985), lot 421. 

This issue was struck during the Fifth Syrian War (202-195 BC). It is the same obverse die as Svoronos 1269, but lacks the NI control on the 
reverse, which is also present on certain silver tetradrachms issued at an uncertain Ptolemaic military mint in Phoenicia during this period. 

In his study of this coinage, Mørkholm argued that most, if not all, of these portrait issues were struck in Phoenician mints, many of the types 
being die-linked with mint marked pieces from Sidon, and most of the hoards being found in that region. In addition, the interlinking of dies 
within each series points to a limited period of minting, perhaps for only a few years after 202 BC, when Ptolemy V was fighting a losing battle 
to keep his Phoenician territories from falling to Antiochos III of Syria. His portrait types, along with rarer types showing his parents Ptolemy 
IV and Arsinoë III, lent immediacy to the Ptolemaic presence in Phoenicia.

The issues of Philip II of Macedon were one of the primary coinages circulating in the Thraco-Macedonian region from the late 4th century 
BC. It was such an integral coinage to the area that official Macedonian issues of Philip II type continued for decades after his death in 336. 
Naturally, this coinage was imitated by various tribes in the Danube region, probably to facilitate trade with cities where the type was a 
recognized medium of exchange, down to the first century BC. The earliest types were reasonably faithful copies of the obverse and reverse 
types, but over time the various tribes &quot;morphed&quot; them, often into abstract designs that only vaguely resembled the originals.

This coin is from a recently discovered type clearly related to the Reiterstumpf/Kroisbach type by virtue of the close similarity of their reverse 
types, as well as the overall style and characteristics of their flans. The obverse type has a stylistic affinity with the left-facing male heads 
on the Apollokopf/Leierblume type, particularly in the details of the face and jaw line (cf. Göbl, OTA 396-398). Both the Reiterstumpf and 
Apollokopf types are attributed to the same general region and time frame, so a new type combining elements of both is not unexpected.

In around 218 BC, at roughly the same time as the appearance of the silver denarius, mints in the Roman Republic began to strike silver coins 
bearing on the obverse a bust of Jupiter and on the reverse a figure of Victory placing a wreath upon a trophy. Known as a victoriatus in Latin 
or tropaikon in Greek, this coin was primarily issued to facilitate payments in Greek-speaking southern Italy, where its weight was roughly 
equivalent to a drachm or half nomos. Rome at this time had a great need for coinage, as the Second Punic War then raged across Italy, and 
the city needed silver to pay her allies. This function is demonstrated by the hoard evidence, which shows that victoriatus circulation was 
generally limited to southern Italy, and later Cisalpine Gaul and Spain. 

The victoriatus was generally struck in less pure silver than the denarius, rarely meeting the same 90% standard, yet it followed the same 
overall pattern of debasements. Despite this, it proved to be an important coin for the budding empire. Though the type was discontinued 
around 170 BC, the coins themselves continued to circulate, eventually becoming worn enough to function in the marketplace as quinarii. 
Accordingly, even into the early Imperial period, the silver quinarius was also sometimes refered to as a victoriatus.

The obverse portrait has sometimes been identified as the famous chief of the Arverni, Vercingetorix, whom Julius Caesar captured in 52 BC in 
Alesia. It is difficult to imagine anyone placing such a dramatic portrait of a defeated foe on their coinage, but it is clear from surviving sources 
of the period that the Romans had a good deal of respect for the Gauls as honorable warriors. Crawford and Sear believe this identification is 
unlikely, but the large, distinctive, and carefully engraved head suggests the die cutter worked with an eye toward creating an individualized 
portrait, rather than a stylized personification of a Gaul. The reverse is also of particular historical interest, in that it depicts the manner in 
which chariots were used in Celtic Gaul, and perhaps in Britain as well.

Aulus Hirtius, praetor at the time this coin was struck, was a close friend of both Cicero and Caesar, and had served as the latter&apos;s legate 
in Gaul. He was consul in 43 BC, having been nominated by Caesar, and was sent along with Octavian and Pansa against Antony, who 
was besieging Decimus Brutus at Mutina. Hirtius defeated Antony but fell while leading the assault on his camp. Hirtius is credited with

While this coin derives its general type from those issues struck at Rome in the month prior to Caesar&apos;s assassination in March 44 BC, its 
anepigraphic obverse now shows a head of Caesar that is no longer veiled, while on the reverse, Venus Genetrix holds a caduceus in place of the 
traditional Victory. The idealized portrait of Julius Caesar, with its definite impression of divinity, is not an individual die-engraver&apos;s attempt 
at artistic fancy, but must have been influenced by Octavian&apos;s consciously conceived program of manipulating public images (including that 
of Caesar) at Rome. On 1 January 42 BC, the Senate recognized Caesar&apos;s new divine status as the Divus Julius and constructed a temple on 
the site of his cremation in the Forum. The Venus Genetrix on the reverse shows a similar manipulation. Deriving from the Greek Aphrodite 
Ourania, or heavenly Aphrodite, Venus Genetrix became not only the divine patroness of Rome through her son Aeneas, but also the ancestor 
of the gens Julia, through Aeneas&apos; son, Ascanius (Iulus). On the night before the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC, Caesar vowed to construct a 
temple in her honor in Rome if he was successful against Pompey. Once completed, this temple, which housed a statue of the goddess, then 
became the centerpiece of his new forum in Rome. There are marked differences, however, between the statue (evidenced by several extant 
copies) and her depiction on the denarii struck in the month before his assassination. While the statue emphasized her procreative powers, 
the coins show her in a more martial and political context: holding a Victory in her right hand and a scepter in her left, either surrounded by 
weaponry (sometime set on a globe), or with the scepter set on a star (a sign of divinity). While these attributes may shift from one to another, 
they emphasize not only the divine assistance in Caesar&apos;s military and political victories, but also allude tentatively to his semi-divinity. The 
Venus of this coin, however, minimizes her connection to earlier associations; instead, she now presents an image of Felicitas (Good Fortune), 
by replacing the Victory with a caduceus. It is not the Venus Genetrix of Julius Caesar, then, but now Venus Felix of all Rome who is at work. 
Thus, through the assistance of the two transformed divine agencies -the impending one of the Divus Julius, and that of Venus -that Octavian 
was able to take his first few steps toward political ascendancy.

P. Cornelius Lentulus Spinther and M. Servilius were joint legates to Cassius and Brutus, and both issued coins in the names of their generals. 
Lentulus Spinther was born in 74 BC and assumed the toga virilis in 57 BC, and in the same year was elected to the college of augurs. After 
the murder of Caesar, he joined the parties of Cassius and Brutus and was probably killed at Philippi. The reverse type of this coin refers to 
Lentulus&apos; appointment to the college of augurs, and is one of the few instances in imperatorial coinage in which a moneyer used a reverse 
type that was personal to himself.

Sear speculates that the striking of this issue took place at Sardis in Lydia, on the occasion of a meeting between the liberatores Brutus and 
Cassius. The meeting was held in private and, as Plutarch and Cassius Dio inform us, led to a very heated exchange, with the generals airing 
their grievances and suspicions of one another. Ultimately, they managed to renew their alliance and made plans for joint military action 
against the triumvirs (and, no doubt, devised ways to raise much-needed troops and money). By October of 42, just months after this coin was 
struck, Octavian and Antony would defeat Cassius and Brutus at the Battle of Philippi. Brutus managed to escape the battle alive but, with 
only four legions at his disposal, his capture was imminent. He took his own life shortly thereafter. 

&quot;Libertas&quot; was a prominent theme on many of the tyrannicides&apos; coins, being the political and ideological impetus behind the assassination of 
Caesar. The reverse type commemorates Brutus&apos; recent victories in Thrace and Lycia (Marcus Servilius, the legate who signed this issue, was 
personally involved in campaigns in the latter province).

The denarius of Tiberius with Pax reverse is commonly known as the &apos;Tribute Penny,&apos; the coin to which Jesus referred to when he was 
discussing the payment of taxes to the Romans: &quot;render to Caesar the things that are Caesar&apos;s, and to God the things that are God&apos;s&quot; (Mark 
12:17). Although there are two other reverse types on the denarii of Tiberius, those were only issued during the first two years of his reign, 
while the Pax reverse was employed throughout the remainder, making it the more likely coin referred to by Jesus. It was also the most 
common imperial-issue coin circulating in the region at the time. The term &apos;penny&apos; is from the 1611 King James translation of the Bible, and 
was adopted since the penny was the standard denomination of the time.

This monumental triumphal arch was erected by Nero to commemorate Roman military campaigns against the Parthians in Mesopotamia and 
Armenia. Although not particularly successful in a military sense, with Paetus losing almost his entire army at Randeia in Armenia, the war did 
end with a peace treaty favorable to Rome that was upheld for nearly fifty years. This coin type is vitally important for architectural historians, 
for the arch was dismantled after Nero&apos;s ignominious end in AD 68, and is only known through its depiction on the coins.

The Weissenberg Family Collection 
Including a Hoard of Roman Coins from the Flavian Era 

CNG is proud to present the Weissenberg Family Collection, an assemblage of coins with a remarkable 
history. Their background touches on the life of the famed violinist Ignacy Weissenberg (also known 
as Izaak Wajsenberg), his harrowing experiences during the Second World War, and a profound act of 
kindness that sparked a multi-generational interest in numismatics. 

A Polish-Jew from Warsaw, Ignacy was an incredibly prodigious musician. In 1911, at only nine years 
of age, he gave his first concert alongside the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra. He entered the Saint 
Petersburg Conservatory two years later, where he trained under the famous professor Leopold Auer and 
quickly became one of his most-promising students, studying alongside the well-known violonists Jascha 
Heifetz and Nathan Milstein. Ignacy became a professor at the Conservatory at Odessa (in modern Ukraine) 
at the age of eighteen, and spent the next two years teaching before returning to Warsaw. From there he 
would embark on a brilliant music career, performing at many of the major concert halls in Europe, South 
America, the United States, and Russia, while also holding a teaching position at the Warsaw Conservatory. 

Ignacy was at the peak of his career in September of 1939, when Germany invaded Poland and launched a 
savage assault on the Polish capital. After Hitler&apos;s forces took the city, he was forced to wear, along with 
his family, the Jewish badge. He married in November of 1939 and shortly thereafter fled Poland with 
his wife Rachel, abandoning their home and Ignacy&apos;s extensive music library, which had taken decades 
to build and included a wealth of rare and important original pieces. The Weissenbergs initially planned 
to escape to Italy by passage through Hungary and Austria, but arrived to find the Italian border closed. 
Next came a daring passage through Germany en route to Belgium, during which time the couple was 
interrogated by the Gestapo (Ignacy was in possession of a work permit to perform in Brussels and was 
able to convince the Nazis that he was going there for a concert). By May of 1940, Ignacy and Rachel left 
for France and shortly thereafter reached the southern zone libre of the newly-established Vichy regime, a 
government that quickly began implementing its own anti-Jewish policies. 

In France, Ignacy and Rachel joined the Sicard family of Agen, with whom they lived for several years during the war, on the recommendation of Louis Fournier, 
director of the national conservatory. Gustave Sicard, the family patriarch, made great efforts to ensure the safety of the Weissenbergs, with the latter crediting him 
and his family for saving their lives. While living with the Sicards, Ignacy was forced to work in labor camps as part of the 308th Company of Foreign Workers. 
Rachel gave birth to a son, Eric, in August of 1941, around the same time police began arresting foreign Jews in southern France. Sixty-one of Ignacy&apos;s coworkers 
in the 308th Company where arrested on 23 August and sent by train to the Drancy internment camp near Paris, then to Auschwitz to be executed. 

Between August 1941 and November 1942, while southern France was under German control, the Sicard family courageously hid the Weissenbergs from police 
raids. With the help of Emile Dunes, the former head of the foreign service of Lot-et-Garonne, Gustave obtained fake French passports for Ignacy and Rachel and 
accompanied them on their journey to the Swiss border. He also presented Ignacy with a remarkable gift on the occasion of his departure from France. 

Gustave would often dig up coins scattered around his garden at Agen (ancient Aginnum), which at the time of discovery were frequently unrecognizable and 
often fused together into thick metallic lumps. Ignace personally cleaned these finds (no doubt a welcome respite during this time), revealing a total of forty-six 
Roman gold and silver coins. These finds seemed to comprise part of a hoard, with a large portion of them dating to the reign of Vespasian. Many of the Flavian 
issues have little to no wear, with the latest dating to AD 79, our terminus post quem for their burial. Gustave gave these coins to Ignacy when he and his family 
left Agen, as they would provide the Weissenbergs with some liquidity if needed. 

The Weissenbergs and Sicards stayed in contact and maintained their friendship after the war, and Ignacy was able to retain possession of the coins that Gustave 
had gifted him. Over time, Ignacy gave some of these coins as presents to his son Eric, who had a burgeoning interest in numismatics, and eventually the entire 
hoard passed into his care. Eric went on to become a lifelong collector of Judaean and Jewish-related coins, focusing primarily on the coinage of the Jewish Wars 
and Roman &quot;Judaea Capta&quot; issues, and in turn left the collection to his sons. 

743. 
A Flavian Era Hoard of Aurei and Denarii. Lot of forty-six (46) coins. Lot consists of eleven gold aurei and 
thirty-five silver denarii discovered at Agen, France. While the exact circumstances of the coins&apos; discovery are uncertain, the 
finds would seem to comprise at least a portion of a hoard deposited during the Flavian Era. Includes the following: AV Aurei: 
Tiberius (2), Nero (6), Vespasian (3) // AR Denarii: Q. Cassius Longinus (1), Octavian/Augustus (5), Claudius (2), Nero (1), 
Vitellius (1), Vespasian (17), Titus (1), Titus or Domitian (1), Domitian (6). Fair to Superb EF. For photographs and detailed 
descriptions of each coin, please see www.cngcoins.com/lot_743.pdf. 
($100,000) 

Said to be retrieved little by little from the gardens of the Sicard family home at Agen in the eastern region of Aquitaine and cleaned by Ignacy 
Weissenberg during his stay with the Sicard family (1939-1942). The coins date from 55 BC to AD 79. The latest coins exhibit little wear, 
suggesting a deposit of 79 or shortly thereafter. 

Agen began as a Celtic settlement called Nitiobroges before being refounded as Aginnum under Augustus. The town became quite prosperous due 
to its location along several major trade routes. The content of Gustave Sicard&apos;s discovery, particularly the presence of coins from the Neronian 
through Flavian eras, is consistent with documented hoards and individual coin finds in the area (see Nony [1990], especially pp. 57ff). 

744. 
Weissenberg Family Collection of Judaean and related coins. Lot of fifty-four (54) coins. Formed over two-
generations, this collection is largely comprised of Judaean issues in silver, bronze, and lead dating from the Hasmonean 
period until the Bar Kochba revolt, as well as various Roman issues related directly or indirectly to the Jewish Wars. Lot also 
includes a small number of civic issues of the Holy Land. Fine to EF. For photographs and detailed descriptions of each coin, 
please see www.cngcoins.com/lot_744.pdf. 
($50,000) 

Regarding the collecting of the &quot;Judaea Capta&quot; series, the Weissenbergs did not limit themselves to what many numismatists define as &quot;Judaea 
Capta&quot; issues, opining that many other victoria types reference the &quot;definitive&quot; Flavian victory -the victory over the Jews. Thus the observer 
will note that this lot contains some issues that are not typically identified as Jewish-related issues in the standard literature.

The Restitution Coinage of Trajan 

Although several Roman emperors re-issued types struck by their predecessors, which modern numismatists call restitution coinage, such 
coinage of Trajan is somewhat of an enigma. Unlike his Julio-Claudian and Flavian predecessors, whose restitution series was limited to 
bronze issues of specific emperors, Trajan struck only aurei and denarii. Issues of certain previous emperors, including Trajan&apos;s immediate 
predecessor Nerva, as well as certain Republican issues, such as an early didrachm that had long been out of circulation. Finally, he struck what 
might rightfully be called a &quot;fantasy&quot; -a coin that was never minted originally. The most obvious example of such a coin is the &quot;restitution&quot; 
aureus of Julius Caesar (see lot 746 below), which pairs a Trajanic-style portrait of the Divus with a reverse type of the emperor Claudius. In 
general, the striking of restitution coinage was meant to legitimize the new regime in the eyes of the populace through an expression of pietas 
to the &quot;good&quot; emperors who deserved to be remembered, as was the case of the Flavians, who included bronze coins of Galba, while omitting 
Caligula, Nero, Otho, and Vitellius (see BMC II, p. lxxviii). In the case of Trajan&apos;s restitution issues, however, legitimacy appears not to be 
the sole reason, since he had been appointed to succeed Nerva prior to the latter&apos;s death and was thus Nerva&apos;s legitimate successor. It does not 
explain the inclusion of Republican issues, not does it explain the inclusion of the Divus Julius hybrid. 

Relative to dating Trajan&apos;s restored coins, the traditional dating of AD 107 is based on Eckhel&apos;s theory linking the restitution coinage with the 
general recoinage that Dio places after Trajan&apos;s return from the Second Dacian War. Bernhard Woytek disagrees, and places their issue in AD 
112/113, surmising that the appearance of Divus Nerva in this coinage must be contemporary to his appearance on an aureus securely dated 
to that period. Curtis Clay, however, pleads for the traditional dating of recoinage which, according to Dio, began circa AD 107. Clay states 
that &quot;If the restored coinage was connected with the recoinage, and the recoinage began circa AD 107, how likely is it that Trajan would have 
waited until AD 112-3 to issue the restored coins resulting from that recoinage?&quot; 

Only with further study of the coinage itself might the purpose of Trajan&apos;s restitution coinage be fully understood.

Hadrian canceled debts and burned promissory notes in a general amnesty for tax arrears, the event this sestertius commemorates. The reverse 
depicts either Hadrian himself or a lictor applying a torch to a heap of documents (stipulationes) symbolizing the debts being canceled. The 
burning occurred in Trajan&apos;s Forum, where Hadrian erected a monument inscribed &quot;the first of all principes and the only one who, by remitting 
nine hundred million sestertii owed to the fiscus, provided security not merely for his present citizens but also for their descendants by this 
generosity.&quot; 

The legend RELIQVA VETERA HS NOVIES MILL ABOLITA literally translates to &quot;old receipts in the amount of nine times a hundred 
thousand sestertii canceled.&quot; The HS is a standard abbreviation for sestertii and, depending upon its context, it can mean a single sestertius, 
a unit of one thousand sestertii, or a unit of one hundred thousand sestertii. Novies means &quot;nine times&quot; and applies to the sestertius as a unit 
of one thousand sestertii. Considering the monumental inscription, the HS in the legend of this sestertius should be interpreted with the 
thousand, or mille, understood. Thus, the figure should be increased to 900 million sestertii, equaling the sum named on Hadrian&apos;s monumental 
inscription.

An interesting contemporary counterfeit that combines an obverse for Marcus Aurelius with a reverse for Commodus, and the legends on 
both sides are blundered. Contemporary counterfeits of Roman coins are often hybrids; perhaps counterfeiters did this intentionally to provide 
themselves with a potential defense that their products were not actually copies of genuine coins. The blundered legends would further support 
this theory.

Faustina Junior. Augusta, AD 147-175. Fourrée Aureus (21mm, 7.20 g, 6h). Contemporary counterfeit. Uncertain 
mint. DIΛ FΛVSTINΛ ΛVGVSTΛ RIII, draped bust right / COS IIII, emperor, togate, standing left, sacrificing over alter to 
left from patera held in extended right hand. Unpublished, but cf. Calico 2098a for a similar imitation likely struck with dies by 
the same engraver as the present piece. Near EF, as made. Fine style forgery, combining an obverse die modeled after Faustina 
Junior and a reverse die modeled after Antoninus Pius. 
($5000) 

Like the similar style counterfeit above (lot 772), which is probably from the same workshop, this piece has been made to a weight 
approximating a genuine aureus. However, as the core consists of lighter base metal, the size (volume) of these counterfeits is noticeably 
larger than genuine aurei.

The mint of Rome could quickly produce massive new issues, as was the case with Didius Julianus, who, on 28 March AD 193, outbid Flavius 
Sulpicianus, the father-in-law of Pertinax, for the empire at the praetorian camp auction, by promising to pay each man 25,000 sestertii. The 
Praetorian Guard by this time was composed of sixteen cohorts of 1000 men each, which meant that Didius had to come up with a total of 40 
million sestertii, 10 million denarii, or 400,000 aurei, if he wanted to remain emperor.

Following the death of Pertinax in AD 193 and the &quot;sale&quot; of the Roman throne by the Praetorian Guard to Didius Julianus, Pescennius Niger, 
the governor of Syria, was hailed emperor by the legions under his command. Septimius Severus, who had been proclaimed emperor by the 
Danubian legions at about the same time, first secured his power by subduing Rome, then marched to encounter Niger. In the ensuing battles, 
Severus proved to be the stronger adversary and Niger was overtaken as he attempted escape to Parthia. He was executed and his head was 
sent to Severus, who then ruthlessly slaughtered the rest of Niger&apos;s family.

At the age of fourteen, Varius Avitus Bassianus (Elagabalus) inherited the office of high priest of the sun-god Elagabalus at Emesa in Syria. 
The cult of his sun god was represented by a sacred stone, and in AD 219 when he moved from Emesa to Rome, he took the stone, probably 
a meteorite, with him. This coin type commemorates this event. During his reign, Elagabalus devoted his efforts to the promotion of his cult 
god, building a lavish temple to house the stone.

RIC IV 260; Calicó 3146a; Cohen 595; BMCRE 818; Biaggi -. Choice EF, lustrous. Well centered on a broad flan. Extremely 
rare, apparently the third known of this reverse type and the second known of this variety. RIC references Cohen who, along 
with BMCRE, cites the piece in Vienna. There are none in CoinArchives, and the type is absent from all the following 
collections: (public) ANS, BM, BN, Boston MFA, Fitzwilliam, Hunterian, Milan, Princeton, Torino, and Uppsala; (private) 
Bahrfeldt, Bement, Biaggi, Brand, Cantoni, Caruso, Echt, A.J. Evans, Garrucci, Giorgi, Hunt, Jameson, Levis, Magnaguti, 
Mazzini, Montagu, Piancastelli, Platt-Hall, Ponton d&apos;Amecourt, de Quelen, Roth, Sartiges, Signorelli, and Trau. Cf. Calicó 
3146 for the unique aureus with the same reverse type, but a different bust type. 
($50,000) 

This extremely limited issue produced in AD 231 to celebrate Severus Alexander&apos;s vicennalia poses some interesting questions for 
numismatists. The year previous, types commemorating Alexander&apos;s decennalia were minted, and were evidently intended to mark a decade 
since Alexander had been installed as Caesar by Elagabalus. Although Melville Jones suggests that coins commemorating vows could be 
struck several years ahead of time (the emperor Valens, for example, celebrated his vicennalia despite only reigning for fourteen years), 
striking an issue an entire decade in advance seems rather unusual. One possibility is that the issue in AD 230 was to commemorate the 
discharge of Alexander&apos;s first set of vows, which were then renewed the following year, at which point another special issue was struck. In 
this sense the two issues would be the precursor of the &quot;VOT X MULT XX&quot; types seen so frequently from the fourth century onwards. This 
coin lacks the &quot;SIC&quot; or &quot;MULT&quot; wording common in later issues, however, and the lapse in time between the decennalia and vicennalia types 
suggests that they were not conceived as two halves of the same issue.

The A.K. Collection 

The A.K. Collection of the coins of the Roman Empire was carefully assembled over several decades with a great deal of thought and 
commitment. The present selection consists of 471 silver and bronze pieces, mostly from the reigns of Elagabalus, Severus Alexander, 
Maximinus I, Maximus, Balbinus, Pupienus and their wives, sisters, mothers, and aunts, including both Imperial and Provincial issues. Within 
the lots of provincial coins and ancient imitations, there are also coins of Trajan, Septimius Severus, Julia Domna, Caracalla, Geta, Macrinus, 
and Diadumenian. 

The quality of the coins ranges from Fine to Extremely Fine. This interesting collection includes some very rare coins as well as pieces 
from important collections such as Dattari, Naegeli, Niggeler, Prinz W(aldeck), Rosen, Steger, Stöcklin, and Voirol. Most of the coins are 
provenanced from auctions or lists or were bought directly from stock such as those of J. Schulman, Amsterdam; Münzhandlung Basel; Münzen 
und Medaillen AG, Basel; Dr. Wruck and Habelt, Berlin; W. Winkel, Bielefeld; Frankfurter Münzhandlung E. Button, later Schweizerischer

A separate, fully illustrated catalog of the complete collection has been compiled, containing the photos and full description of all the 
coins in each lot. This catalog will be available during the Triton lot viewing at the Grand Hyatt New York, but you may also request 
that a catalog be sent to you. Additionally, this catalog will be available online (see individual lots below for details).

Julius Marinus, Father of Philip I 

826. 
Divus Julius Marinus. Died circa AD 246/7. AE (23mm, 5.60 g, 6h). Philippopolis (Arabia) mint. Struck circa 
AD 247-249. ΘЄΩ MAPINΩ, bareheaded bust right, slight drapery on far shoulder, supported by eagle standing right / 
ΦIΛIΠΠOΠOΛIT-ΩN KOΛ[ΩNIAC], Roma or Allat standing left, holding patera and spear, with shield at side; S C across

The father of Philip I, Julius Marinus hailed from a small town in the province of Arabia (modern day Shuhba, Syria; the original name of the 
ancient town is unknown). Following the death of Marinus, Philip deified his father and had a temple to him built in his newly aggrandized 
hometown -now renamed Philippopolis and elevated to the rank of colonia. 

The neat fabric of the city&apos;s coins is quite out of place for Arabia. This, combined with die links between the coins of Philippopolis, Zeugma, 
and Antioch, point to production at a central location, with Antioch being the likeliest candidate.

($5000) 

This reverse type is known on two rare issues of aurei of Gallienus, which Göbl placed at Milan mint, during its second emission (MIR 36, 
945gg and 946gg). However, the obverse die on these antoniniani is certainly engraved by the same hand as MIR 36, 375aa, which is the only 
issue with a matching obverse type (all other helmeted bust types of Gallienus incorporate a radiate crown into the helmet). That issue Göbl 
rightly placed in the sixth emission of Rome, due to its reverse type that bears the conventional officina marking used at Rome at that time. The 
present piece suggests that the two aurei should be reattributed to Rome, since no other aspect of those issues demands a placement at Milan, 
and the reverse type is one that is intimately related to the foundation of the city of Rome: In Roman mythology, Mars and Rhea Silvia were 
the parents of Romulus and Remus, the legendary founders of Rome, and this scene depicts the encounter that led to their conception. While 
the mint assignment and dating are rather clear, the perplexing issue is the reverse legend, which cites tribunician and consular terms that are 
impossible for Gallienus, and such an irregularity seems at odds with a product of the Rome mint.

Victorinus hailed from a wealthy Gallic family, serving in the army and eventually becoming praetorian tribune and consul of the Gallic 
Empire under Postumus. Assuming the purple after the murder of Postumus, Victorinus initially met with limited support. The province of 
Hispania broke away, returning to the fold of the central Roman Empire, while southern Gaul threatened to do the same. Victorinus managed 
to hold onto Gaul only to meet his death a few years later, at the hands of a jealous general whose wife he was rumored to have seduced.

The revolt of Domitius Domitianus in Egypt destabilized a vitally strategic region by interrupting the grain supply to Rome and opening 
the possibility of Persian (Sasanian) invasion. For almost a year, Domitius Domitianus controlled Alexandria and its mint, striking there, in 
addition to aurei, and folles which contained an eagle on the reverse, a series of pre-reform imperial Greek denominations. A major question 
regarding these latter coins has been what were their specific values. For the most part, scholars agree that the larger coins featuring the radiate 
bust must be a double, and thereby call it an octodrachm. At half the weight, then, the smallest coins with the Nike on the reverse must be 
tetradrachms, though these coins have erroneously been called heretofore didrachms. The weights of these tetradrachms appear consistent 
with the final issues of pre-reform tetradrachms of the Tetrarchs. The middle denomination poses the largest challenge to this arrangement. 
By weight, it should be a hexadrachm. However, no such denomination was known to have been struck in Egypt, though tetradrachms earlier 
in the third century achieved this weight. The obvious problem here would be the confusion caused in circulating the same denomination in 
two different weights. As this type is the rarest of the group, it is possible that it was meant for a special occasion, or more remotely, a stalled 
attempt to reinstitute the pre-reform coinage on an earlier weight standard. Further investigation may shed more light on this subject.

The Usurper Alexander of Carthage 

L. Domitius Alexander led a short-lived revolt against Maxentius from AD 308 to 310, holding Africa and Sardinia. There is little known about 
this usurper, but there is evidence in an inscription (CIL VIII, 22183) that he and Constantine allied themselves in opposition to Maxentius. 
P. Salama in &quot;Recherches numismatiques sur l&apos;usurpateur africain L. Domitius Alexander,&quot; Proceedings of the International Numismatic 
Congress 1973, p. 365, note 2, suggests that at the latest, the pact was entered into by autumn of 310.

This rare issue was probably produced for Licinius as he passed eastward through Siscia on his way to confront Maximinus early in AD 313. 
Licinius and Constantine had met in Milan to cement their alliance (and issue the Edict of Milan, which established religious tolerance in the 
Empire), when Maximinus invaded Thrace. Licinius hastily departed Milan, passing through Siscia on his way to defeat Maximinus near 
Adrianople.

The Usurper Martinian 

During his war with Constantine, Licinius appointed his magister officiorum, Martinian, as his co-emperor. The new Augustus was then 
deployed to Lampsacus to oppose Constantine&apos;s army as it crossed the Hellespont. After his defeat, Martinian was imprisoned in Cappadocia, 
where he was later executed on Constantine&apos;s orders. During his brief reign, Martinian struck coinage at two mints, Nicomedia and Cyzicus. 
The great majority of his known coins are from Nicomedia, and there are only three Martinian folles from Cyzicus in CoinArchives.

Cohen 76 = Welzl von Wellenheim 15358. Choice EF. Extremely rare, perhaps the second known. 
($20,000) 

Cohen, who included this type in his catalog of Roman coinage and cited coin 15358 in the collection of Leopold Welzl von Wellenheim 
(1773-1848), noted after the description that &quot;this coin seems to have been misread; the mint of Ravenna was not yet seen under Julian the 
Philosopher.&quot; As Welzl von Wellenheim&apos;s collection was unillustrated and had been dispersed prior to Cohen&apos;s publication, Cohen was 
apparently unable to check the reference or view the actual coin, therefore relying on the otherwise unknown foundation of the Ravenna mint 
in AD 402 for his conclusion that the coin had been misread. Subsequent numismatists have taken Cohen at his word, and not included this 
extremely rare gold issue of Julian in their studies of this mint. Our coin confirms that Welzl von Wellenheim&apos;s reading was correct, while 
Cohen&apos;s assumption was incorrect, and that, if only for the briefest moment, a mint was in operation there. 

The likely circumstances leading to this issue become clear on a review of the events in Julian&apos;s rise to power. Although Julian had spent his 
early years in scholarly pursuits, in his early 20s he was ordered by his half-cousin Constantius II to come to the service of the empire. In 355 
Julian was appointed Caesar and was entrusted with the defense of Gaul against Germanic invasion. Julian proved a talented soldier as well as 
an outstanding administrator, and earned the loyalty of his troops. Constantius II, concerned at the growing popularity of his junior colleague, 
sought to the limit Julian&apos;s success, and finally ordered a large part of Julian&apos;s army to leave Julian and join Constantius&apos; eastern army. 

Julian&apos;s army refused to obey Constantius&apos; command and instead raised the reluctant Julian to the rank of Augustus in Paris in February AD 
360. Julian spent the next year securing the Rhine frontier. Then, in the spring of AD 361, before marching on Constantinople, Julian moved 
to secure Italy and the Balkans. He sent a portion of his troops to Northern Italy while leading another portion down the Danube. However, 
in June forces loyal to Constantius captured Aquileia, threatening to cut Julian off from his forces in Italy while Constantius&apos; own forces 
approached from the east. Troops loyal to Julian then besieged Aquileia. The anticipated clash between the main armies was avoided only by 
the death of Constantius in Constantinople on 3rd November. 

The present coin, struck in Ravenna and with its reverse type honoring the Gallic army, must date from the summer or autumn of AD 361. 
Julian&apos;s Gallic forces in northern Italy apparently needed to strike an emergency coinage in order to defray urgent expenses. These may have 
been connected with naval operations, as Ravenna was the home port for the Roman fleet guarding the eastern Mediterranean, and control of 
the sea would have been critical in the efforts to retake Aquileia. 

This dating, if accepted, also indicates that J.P.C. Kent was correct when he proposed in 1959 that the VIRTVS EXERC GALL coinage 
(otherwise struck by Julian only at Arelate and Lugdunum) was to be dated to AD 361 (J.P.C. Kent, &apos;An introduction to the coinage of Julian 
the Apostate&apos;, NC 1959, p. 112). Kent later changed his mind and re-assigned the VIRTVS EXERC GALL coinage to the end of Julian&apos;s 
reign (RIC VIII p. 175). However, assuming that the VIRTVS EXERC GALL coinage was all issued in the same general period, the present 
coin of this type from Ravenna must prove Kent&apos;s earlier view to be correct. There is no occasion later in Julian&apos;s reign that would require 
an emergency coinage at Ravenna. Moreover, the issue at Ravenna of this type honoring the Gallic army only makes sense in the context of 
AD 361 when a portion of the Gallic army itself was in northern Italy. Remarkably, forty years elapsed before Ravenna next issued coinage 
in AD 402.

18th Century Record of the Vatican Holdings 
Strong in Roman Medallions 

873. 
A collection of sulfur casts produced after coins and medals in the Vatican Cabinet. 18th century. A remarkable 
group of over 500 sulfur casts of holdings from the Vatican Medagliere, likely produced in the later 18th century and certainly 
before 1797, when a number of the original pieces were transferred to France as part of the Treaty of Tolentino. The collection 
is primarily comprised of imperial issues, but also includes casts of Greek and Roman Provincial coins. Of particular note are 
the Roman medallions, many of which replicate unique and extremely rare types (at least one medallion of Hadrian is now 
lost and otherwise known only from an inferior cast in the British Museum). All coins are housed in original wooden trays 
that have been hand-numbered to coincide with three manuscripts, each written in Italian and providing brief descriptions of 
the types. An important offering of great historical interest, and an ideal lot for a museum or a specialist in Roman medallions. 
Some casts broken/repaired, otherwise as made.

First Known Theodore Hyperpyron -Important Discovery Piece 

895. 
Theodore I Comnenus-Lascaris. Emperor of Nicaea, 1208-1222. AV Hyperpyron (32mm, 4.39 g, 6h). Uncertain 
(Nicaea or Magnesia) mint. K[Є RO-]HΘ-ЄI, facing beardless bust of Christ Pantokrator; IC-XC across field / [...]Π T 
ΘЄOΔωPO[C], Theodore, wearing crown and loros and holding labarum, and St. Theodore, in military outfit and holding spear, 
standing facing, holding patriarchal cross between them. Unpublished in the standard references. Superb EF. 
($5000) 

This previously unknown hyperpyron appears to be the first hyperpyron that can be attributed to Theodore I Comnenus-Lascaris, for whom 
previously only tracheis were known. The emperor is depicted here with a forked beard, and the only emperors in this period with a forked 
beard are Andronicus I, Theodore I, John III, and Michael VIII. The military saint on the reverse is St. Theodore, identified likewise by his 
forked beard as well as the legend. He is the patron saint of Theodore I, and the form of this reverse is exactly the same as that of the first 
type of billon trachea of Theodore I (DOC IV, pl. XXVII, 5) which has the seated Virgin as the obverse. The bust of Christ on the present 
coin might indicate the superior denomination. 

We would like to thank Simon Bendall for assistance in the attribution of this coin.

The ekdikoi were a college of priests responsible for the administration of holy sites, and had a further judicial function, in that accused 
criminals who sought asylum in churches would be judged by them. The office was established by Justinian I, but did not acquire a real 
presence in the administration of church affairs until the 11th century.

Extremely rare and possibly unique. Of great historical importance. 
($3000) 

Acquired by the consignor from Numismatique Antique, Montpellier, France; reportedly from an old Parisian collection. 

In their 1962 Numismatic Circular article, Veglery and Zacos noted that they had inspected a unique specimen of this type and planned to 
fully publish it at a later date. That article, unfortunately, never came to fruition, and Bendall and Donald (LPC) subsequently based their 
description on Veglery and Zacos&apos; cursory 1962 account. Since Veglery and Zacos did not illustrate the coin that they had inspected and did 
not include its weight, it is unclear if that coin is the same as our piece, which previously belonged to an old Parisian collection. 

The present coin is published with a full discussion in an article by Tencho Popov, (&quot;Две Уникални Късновизантийски Сребърни Mонети&quot; 
[&quot;Two unique Late Byzantine Silver Coins&quot;], Минало No. 3 (2017). We thank the author for generously sharing his research with us. 

Andronicus III was crowned co-emperor with his grandfather on 25 February 1325 (Bosch, p.35), and on this occasion two types of basilika, 
classified by Veglery and Zacos as Type II and Type III, were minted. On these types, the two co-emperors are each represented individually, 
one on the obverse and the other on the reverse. However, two facts lead to the conclusion that Types II and III are later than Type I (our coin): 
the published specimens of Types II and III have reduced weights of 1.71, 1.73 and 1.63 g (Veglery and Zacos, p.78), and depict Andronicus 
III wearing a short, circular beard. Therefore, the three types are not synchronous in date; Type I, the heavier series depicting a beardless 
Andronicus III, must be earlier in date. But under what historical circumstances would this earlier coinage have been struck? 

It is known that after the death of his father, Michael IX, the younger Andronicus rebelled against his grandfather, which grew into a civil war. 
The older and younger Andronici reached a treaty on 6 June 1321, with Andronicus II recognizing his grandson as his heir and co-emperor 
(Bosch, p.24). It is likely at that time, perhaps at the insistence of the younger emperor, that the Type I coinage was struck. Since relations 
between the two emperors worsened again by October of 1321, and with the next stage of the civil war ensuing, the coinage would have been 
suspended, shortly after it was started. This dating would explains the exceptional rarity of this coin type. 

The Rebel Andronicus IV 

898.

rare type. 
($2500) 

From the Iconodule Collection. 

The tension between John V Palaeologus and his eldest son and heir, Andronicus IV, led the latter to openly rebel. In 1373, Andronicus allied 
himself with the Ottoman prince Savci Bey, who was leading a revolt against his own father, emperor Murad I. A battle ensued between 
the joint forces of Andronicus and Savci Bey and those of John and Murad, with the rightful emperors emerging victorious. Savci Bey was 
subsequently executed while Andronicus was shown greater mercy; he was imprisoned and sentenced to be blinded, but apparently lost vision 
in only one eye. 

With Genoese support, Andronicus escaped from prison in the summer of 1376 and formed an alliance with his old enemy Murad I. Andronicus 
soon took Constantinople and was crowned emperor, but John V was able to reclaim the throne in 1379 (with the assistance, once again, of 
Murad). Remarkably, John reinstated Andronicus as heir and co-regent in 1381, but his traitorous son rebelled again in 1385 and died shortly 
thereafter.

The Merovingians were a dynasty of Frankish kings who ruled in parts of present-day France and Germany from the fifth to the eighth century 
AD. Sometimes referred by their contemporaries as the &quot;long-haired kings&quot; (Latin reges criniti) because they symbolically left their hair 
uncut, the Merovingians claimed descent from the legendary fifth century AD leader of the Germanic Salii, Merovech. Initially foederati of 
the Romans, the Franks migrated into northern Gaul, where they settled and established petty kingdoms. There, they adapted themselves to 
the local economy by issuing imitations of circulating Roman and Byzantine coinage (mostly solidi and tremisses). These smaller kingdoms 
were soon united under Clovis [Clodowech] (481-511), the founder of the Merovingian dynasty. During his reign, the last vestiges of Roman 
rule were extinguished, other competing regional Germanic tribes were absorbed, and the Visigoths, who were likewise issuing imitations 
of Roman and Byzantine coins, were pushed southward into Spain. To strengthen his position, Clovis allied himself with the Church, and 
on Christmas Day, AD 496, he was baptized at Rheims.When Clovis died in 511, his kingdom was divided among his four sons, and, over 
a period of time, four main regional divisions were established: Neustria and Austrasia in the north; Aquitaine and Burgundy in the south. 
This tradition of dividing the kingdom proved an inherent weakness in the Merovingian state. This situation resulted in the proliferation of 
gold tremisses, issued not only from the royal palace mints, but also from many civic mints. Eventually, these local areas also struck silver 
coins. Known to modern numismatists as deniers, they suggest a vibrant local economy, in which coinage tended to be used frequently in 
transactions. The city of Marseilles is an especially important example of this robust economy. A hub of Mediterranen trade for this period, 
the city struck both gold an silver issues, the silver struck under a local patricius, Nemfidius. 

Throughout much of the rest of the dynasty, struggles ensued as various heirs vied among themselves for a larger share of the royal inheritance. 
While some of Clovis&apos; descendants, most notably Clotaire I (558-561) and Dagobert I (629-639), were able to rule briefly as king over all of 
these areas, most of the kings were weak and relied on their palace chiefs of staff, colloquially known as the &quot;mayor of the palace&quot; (Lat. maior 
domus), who soon became de facto rulers. In 751, the mayor, Pépin le Bref (the Short), removed his Merovingian overlord, assumed the title 
of king, and became the first in the next dynasty of Frankish kings, the Carolingians. 

One of the so-called rois fainéants, Childeric II was the second son of Clovis II and, like his father before him, was still a child when he was 
proclaimed king in Austrasia in 662 and King of the Franks in 673. When Childeric&apos;s younger brother, Theuderic III, inherited the kingdoms 
of Neustria and Burgundy that same year, a faction of prominent Burgundian nobles invited Childeric to become king of those kingdoms 
instead. Successfully invading his brother&apos;s kingdoms and supplanting him, Childeric also removed the local maior domus, Eboin, with his 
own Austrasian one, thereby upsetting his nobles. Soon, a group of Neustrian nobles, Bodilo, Amalbert and Ingobert, formed a conspiracy 
to assassinate Childerc, his wife and sons, while the royal party was hunting in the forest of Livry (present-day Lognes). Their youngest son, 
Daniel, who had been sent off to a monestary for his protection, returned many years later to rule as Chilperic II.

By the end of the sixth century AD, diplomatic ties between the Byzantine Empire and southern Gaul were reestablished after having lapsed a 
century earlier. The resumption of ties was marked by the introduction of Merovingian pseudo-imperial coinage during the final years of the 
reign of Justin II (574-578). At first these coins were struck on a limited scale and under strict control of a centralized minting authority, which 
supervised all the mints, legalized the reduced local standard, and possibly supplied the dies. By 580, however, this control broke down, and 
soon some mints began striking issues of clearly inferior style and often with illiterate legends. Elsewhere, while mints such as Arles might 
conform briefly to centralized standards, they too soon lapsed into striking more &quot;localized&quot; types. 

During this period, only Marseille, by far the most active of the Gallic mints, as well as the only one to continue proclaiming loyalty to the 
Byzantine emperor, continued to remain under strict control, while it increased its output sharply by coining the heavy imperial subsidies 
flowing into the area in return for Frankish military assistance. 

In the final years of the reign of Maurice Tiberius, and certainly by 596, Marseille, now the chief regional mint, reintroduced a small, more 
tightly controlled pseudo-imperial issue in the name of Maurice Tiberius, which the mint continued to strike after the emperor&apos;s death. Like 
those coins issued under Justin II, this new issue was more than likely a resurgence of the Byzantine contact with the area that had been 
allowed to lapse during the preceding years. Although, as before, the other regional mints, such as Uzès, Viviers, and Arles also briefly 
participated, they soon fell into obscurity, and Marseilles became the main southern Gallic mint. 

Upon the death of Maurice Tiberius, Marseilles halfheartedly accepted the rule of Phocas. Although a very small and extremely rare issue was 
struck in the name of the new emperor, the mint preferred to continue striking the Maurice Tiberius type until the succession of Heraclius in 
610, when it briefly struck coins commemorating his new rule. Subsequently, the Merovingian kings, at last able to exert their authority over 
southern Gaul, took over control of Marseilles and its mint and began striking issues in their own names.

several Merovingian kings. Born into an influential Gallo-Roman family, he was apprenticed to a goldsmith. Later he was employed by 
the royal treasurer of the Kingdom of Neustria, there being commissioned by the king, Clotaire II, to fashion a golden throne. Because of 
Eligius&apos; scrupulous honesty, Clothaire, as King of the Franks, appointed him master of the mint at Marseilles. During this same time, Eligius 
also did goldwork in Paris, increasing his reputation not only for his skill, but also his honesty, Following Clothaire&apos;s death, his son and 
successor,Dagobert I, appointed Eligius as a chief counselor. Following Dagobert&apos;s death in 639 and the regency of his successor, Clovis 
II, who was then only a child of five, Eligius continued to serve in the government of the new king&apos;s mother, Nanthild. However, Eligius&apos; 
reputation got him appointed bishop of Noyon-Tournai in 642. This diocese also included Ghent and Kortrijk in Flanders. Since most of the 
inhabitants were pagans, Eligius spent his remaining years in the area, undertaking their conversion, as well as that of the Frisians and Suevi. 
He died in 660.

Tukharistan was the name of a large district to the east of the great city of Balkh, extending along the southern bank of the Oxus river as far 
as the mountains of Badakhshan, and stretching south as far as the mountain ranges north of Banjhir and Bamiyan. This Umayyad dirham is 
the only known coin from any dynasty with this mint-name. 

According to Mosanef and Saffar, at the time of the Muslim conquests Tukharistan was ruled by a Sasanian governor. During the caliphate 
of &apos;Uthman (AH 23-35) the famous governor of Khurasan, &apos;Abdallah ibn &apos;Amir, sent forces eastwards into Tukharistan under the command 
of Ahnaf ibn Qays. Ahnaf soon captured Marw, and after defeating a large Sasanian army moved on to capture several towns before finally 
entering Balkh, where the two sides signed a peace treaty. Some years later Firuz, son of the last Sasanian king Yazdigerd III, invaded 
Tukharistan in an ill-fated attempt to restore Sasanian rule. He was defeated in AH 47 and fled to China, after which Tukharistan seems to 
have remained relatively peaceful for the next thirty years. 

In AH 78, al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf appointed Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra to the governorship of Khorasan. Muhallab spent two years in Tukharistan 
while his son campaigned further east as far as Bukhara. Another decade of eastern conquests under Qutayba ibn Muslim Bahili was to follow. 

Although Mosanef and Saffar read the date on this coin as thamanin (&quot;eighty&quot;), it is clearly thaman (&quot;eight&quot;). While thamanin may be 
possible, the date thaman [wa saba&apos;in], (&quot;seventy-eight&quot;) seems more likely, given the historical context. The date would then coincide with 
the appointment of Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra as governor of Khorasan.

This extremely rare mint-name has not been read with certainty. Bayburd, in Anatolia, is a possible reading but unlikely on historical grounds. 
Album suggests Tanbarak as a variant form of Tabarak, a name given to several fortresses in Iran and possibly the place known in Parthian 
times as Tambrax.

Qaramita was the popular nickname of a group of Isma&apos;ili Shīas. After challenging unsuccessfully the &apos;Abbasids, the Qaramita established an 
Isma&apos;ili republic in eastern Arabia. From there, they raided western Arabia and Iraq, stealing the Black Stone of the Kaaba during a raid on 
Mecca. In AD 909, al-Mahdi, the Qaramita candidate for caliph, with the help of the Berbers, established the Fatimid dynasty.

Unpublished and of the highest rarity. Although the Timurids struck an abundant silver coinage, with both Sunni and Shi&apos;a religious legends, 
examples of their gold coinage are excessively rare. Presumably this coin, with its outstandingly graceful calligraphy, was struck for ceremonial 
occasions. Husayn Bayqara chose to encourage and preside over a brilliant cultural and political life in Harat, whose &quot;beh bud&quot; (&quot;prosperity&quot;) 
motto is proclaimed on the reverse of these coins. He became famous for the artistic excellence of his surviving buildings, and as a patron of 
the arts, who encouraged the intellectual and artistic life of Harat, and wrote his own poetry in both Persian and Turkish. Despite the words 
&quot;Allah ta&apos;aala&quot; (&quot;God the most high&quot;) on the obverse of this coin, Husayn Bayqara was not a religious zealot. He issued Sunni coins in Sunni 
areas and Shi&apos;a coins in Twelver Shi&apos;a areas, and offended the pious with his neglect of the prescribed prayers, refusal to fast and enjoyment 
of wine. By AH 906 (1501) the style of rule made the fall of the Timurids inevitable. The Uzbek Sunni ruler Muhammad Shaybani conquered 
Samarkand, while the Shi&apos;ite Shah Isma&apos;il I laid the foundations of the great Safavid empire. One year after his death, the Shaybanis entered 
Herat and Husayn Bayqara&apos;s sons fled the city.

Vintler (1815-1892) describing the medal as part of the family collection . 
($10,000) 

Ex Dorotheum (16 November 2016), lot 656; Vintler zu Platsch und Runkelstein (Brunecker Linie) family. 

The Tyrolean noble family of von Vintler zu Platsch und Runkelstein (Brunecker Linie) had a long and distinguished association with the 
House of Hapsburg, as well as other noble families in Tyrol and Germany. Due to the family&apos;s wealth, Niklas Vintler, in 1385, purchased the 
Schloss Runkelstein, which became the family seat for the next 150 years. One member of the family, Konrad III (died 1480), was so well 
respected that he helped negotiate a treaty between Tyrol and Bavaria, and was the tutor/confessor to Eleonora, the daughter of James I of 
Scotland and wife of Sigismund, the Archduke of Austria. Given the family tradition that family possession of this medal goes back to the 
time of the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, it is possible that it was acquired by Konrad himself, who may have been somehow involved 
in the the marriage of Maximilian to Maria. 

The union of Maria, the daughter of Charles the Bold and Duchess of Burgundy, with Maximilian, the son of the Holy Roman Emperor, 
Frederick III, and future Holy Roman Emperor himself, was the result of much political intrigue and resulted in the establishment of the 
Habsburgs as the preeminent political family in Europe. The untimely death of Charles the Bold in early 1477 left his ninteen-year-old 
daughter, Maria, the heiress of the sizable and far-reaching Duchy of Burgundy. Hoping to make inroads into the Burgundian Netherlands, 
Louis XI of France claimed the entire duchy on the grounds of the old Salic Law, which excluding females from the inheritance of a throne 
or fief. He proposed that Maria be betrothed to the Dauphin, an arrangement which Maria rejected. Advised by her step-mother, Margaret of 
York, the sister of both Edward IV and Richard III, Maria appealed to the Netherlands for assistance. In return, she was compelled to grant 
a number of concessions. Following her &quot;Joyous Entry&quot; into Ghent in February 1477, Maria signed the Great Privilege, a document laying 
out these concessions and one of the first steps on the road to Dutch independence. In the meantime, the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick 
III, had begun proposing his son, Maximilian, as a possible suitor. Not wanting to ally herself with the French, Maria accepted Maximilian 
as her choice, marrying him in August 1477. Maximilian proved an effective husband and political ally. He stabilized the situation in the 
Netherlands, creating a bond between the Habsburgs and the populace. In addition, the son of Maximilian and Maria, Philip the Handsome, 
would marry Juana, the daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain. Their son, Charles (who was born in Ghent), would succeed Ferdinand 
as King of Spain in 1506, and Maximilian in 1519 as Holy Roman Emperor.

After the death of Charles VII, the succession was disputed between Louis XI, the eldest son, and Charles, the youngest. Though the 
disagreement resulted in few major battles, it was a continued source of unrest between the monarch, his brother, and the nobles, until Louis 
reconciled with his brother, granting him the duchy of Aquitaine as a compromise. The coins issued by Charles for this territory are the last of 
a series that includes many of the varied and impressive issues of the Anglo-Gallic series, with this coin harkening back to a type commonly 
used by Edward the Black Prince.

The Thirty Years&apos; War was one of the longest and most destructive of European conflicts and involved most of the states of continental Europe. 
A religious war, it divided the continent between Roman Catholic and Protestant, with both sides viewing the conflict in specifically religious 
terms. Such views were widely represented on the coinage of the time, thereby conveying the sense of apocalypse felt by the inhabitants. 
These images became a convenient shorthand for villifying the opposition and, in this case, the Whore of Babylon was meant to represent the 
Papacy. The image on this halbtaler derives from Revelation 17:3-4 -

&quot;and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. 
And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having 
a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication.&quot; 

The county Schaumberg-Pinneberg had originally been Roman Catholic until the time of Otto IV (circa 1531-1576), who adopted Lutheran 
teachings, but did not openly confront the Church, since his brothers each were Archbishop-Electors of Cologne. By the time of Ernst, 
however, Schaumberg-Pinneberg was Lutheran. Because of this, the county did experience some war damage during the Thirty Years&apos; War. 
Following Ernst&apos;s death in 1622, he was succeded by a Roman Catholic relative, Jobst Herman, who ruled without attempting to change the 
religion of the territories under his rule. His successor, Otto V, (1635-1640) was a Calvinist, though he himself did not try to steer his territories 
away from Lutheranism, which its inhabitants continue to follow to today.

Numismatically, the coinage of the Mughal emperor Jahangir is quite interesting, for during his reign a number of quite artistic and unusual 
issues were struck. Among these, his gold mohurs are some of the most special and sought after. In addition to the mohurs, each of which 
feature a personified constellation of the zodiac on the obverse, Jahangir also had minted two types, featuring himself. In addition to our coin, 
a mohur, bearing a portrait of the Jahangir was also struck. These two types are some of the rarest and most desired mohurs of all. According 
to the contemporary historian, Muhammad Hashim Khafi Khan, Jahangir ordered the striking of his portrait mohur for his favored amirs or 
servants. More than likely this issue, with the emperor seated and holding a goblet, would have served the same purpose.

This seal was used sometime after 7 December 1782 by Tipu when he succeeded his father Hyder Ali. Known as the &quot;Tiger of Mysore&quot;, Tipu 
expanded Mysore&apos;s power in southern India through a series of enlightened reforms and successful wars against his neighbors. The wealth 
of his court made it a great source of patronage for the arts. Tipu&apos;s abilities attracted the eye of the French, who hoped to employ him as a 
diversion against the British. Seeking an alliance with the Sultan, the French supplied him with arms and advisors. During the Third Anglo-
Mysore War (1789-1792), Tipu, after initial success, was defeated by forces of the East India Company under the command of Charles, Lord 
Cornwallis, who had been appointed the Governor-General of India several years after his defeat against the Franco-American forces at 
Yorktown. Tipu was allowed to remain on the throne but he was forced to cede territory and hand over two of his sons as hostages, as well 
as pay a cash indemnity. Napoleon&apos;s invasion of Egypt prompted a new alliance between the French and Tipu, leading to the Fourth Anglo-
Mysore War (1799). The war culminated in the storming of Tipu&apos;s island stronghold Seringapatnam by the British, led by Colonel Arthur 
Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington). Tipu Sultan died in the battle and many of his treasures were brought back to England by the victors.

The eldest son of Jaime I of Aragon and his second wife Violante of Hungary, Pietro spent much of his his youth and early adulthood 
fighting his father&apos;s wars of the Reconquista against the Moors, where he gain a great deal of military experience for his future enterprises. 
His marriage on 13 June 1262 to Constanza II of Sicily, daughter of King Manfredo, provided him with the legitimate excuse to remove the 
&quot;usurper&quot; Carlo I d&apos;Angiò, who had seized control of the region following Manfredo&apos;s death in 1266. In early 1282, a popular rebellion, 
known as the War of the Sicilian Vespers, broke out in reaction to the rule of Carlo. Taking advantage of this situation, Pietro launched his 
invasion to claim the throne for himself. Although he installed himself successfully on the throne and Carlo was driven into exile in Naples, 
the remainder of Pietro&apos;s short reign in Sicily was beset by warfare. The first involved his conflict with Carlo and was halted short of of trial 
by duel arranged in France to be judged by Edward I of England. While Pietro was ultimately successful against Carlo, the second conflict, 
the Aragonese Crusade, beginning in 1284 and continuing until Pietro&apos;s death the following year, embroiled France in the region and helped 
to undermine Aragonese power.

This coinage has long intrigued numismatists, because while it looks like a typical Carolingian coin type of the early-mid ninth century, it does 
not bear the name of a Frankish ruler, but instead the legends Deus conserva Romanorum imperium (&quot;may God preserve the Roman empire&quot;) 
and Christe salva Venecias (&quot;may Christ save Venice&quot;). The design, a pelleted cross on one face and a temple on the other, is very familiar 
from Carolingian coins. It was first introduced in this developed form by Louis the Pious in 822 or 823, after which every mint throughout the 
empire struck the Christiana religio type. Only one hoard is known to have contained any of these rare Venetian coins. Found at Hermenches 
in Switzerland in 1921, it contained two coins of this type and over 320 of Louis&apos; Christiana religio issues. There were no coins minted after 
840, and none of the temple coins struck on a larger flan which can be attributed to Louis II. This indicates that the hoard was deposited before 
the death of Louis the Pious in 840, and thus that this Venetian coinage also dates from the same period. 

Although the coinage was dated to the reign of Louis II (855-875) in the nineteenth century, several other factors confirm a date between 823 
and 840. First, the weights of these coins and the silver content are lower than those usually found under Louis the Pious. An important study 
in the Revue Numismatique in 2008 showed that Louis the Pious&apos; Class 2 coins from Venice were likewise struck to a lower weight standard 
than coins from other mints, and also contained less silver. Second, nearly all Louis&apos; Class 2 coins, with the mint-name in field, bore an 
unpelleted cross on the obverse, while virtually all Christiana religio issues included pellets around the cross, like these coins. It is interesting 
to note that a small number of other mints are known to have produced a mint-signed temple coinage late in Louis&apos; reign: Dorestad, Maastricht, 
Verdun, Cologne and now (an as yet unpublished find), Aachen. Third, most of Louis&apos; Class 2 coins from Venice have MP ligatures, as these 
coins do, a feature which is hardly ever seen on coins of other mints. 

A final reason for ascribing these coins to the 820s or 830s is the similarity of style which permits the attribution of a large group of Louis 
the Pious&apos; Christiana religio coinage to the Venice mint (Coupland Group G). Some of these similarly have the MP ligatures characteristic 
of Venice, but above all it is the chunky, block-like lettering of the inscriptions and the flattened appearance of the cross and temple which 
strongly resembles the style of this independent Venetian coinage. Large numbers of these Group G coins have been found in hoards and as 
single finds, while these Venetian coins remain extremely rare.

The son of Johann III of Sweden and his first wife, Katarzyna Jagiellonka of Poland, Zygmunt III Wasa was elected to the throne of the 
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1587. His long reign as its king (1587-1632), coincided with high point of the Polish-Lithuanian Com-
monwealth. Hoping to create a personal union between the Commonwealth and Sweden, he used his position to take the Swedish throne in 
1592. Fearing that Zygmunt might use this as an opportunity to re-establish Roman Catholicism in Protestant Sweden, Zygmunt&apos;s uncle, Karl, 
became the leader of the Protestant opposition in Sweden. As king-elect, Zygmunt was forced to confirm the resolutions of the 1593 Uppsala 
Synod, recognizing that Sweden was a Lutheran Protestant state. Under this agreement, Karl, along with the Swedish Privy Council, would 
share power with the king and rule in his place, since Zygmunt remained in Poland. In 1594, the Swedish Parliament elected Karl as regent. 
In sympathy with the king, the nobility of Finland (then a part of the Swedish Kingdom), led by Klaus Fleming, rejected this appointment, 
considering Karl to be a rebel. To counterattack Fleming, Karl instigated a rebellion among the local peasants in a rebellion. Known as the 
Cudgel War (1596-1597), this rebellion precipitated a larger civil war between Sweden and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Through 
a series of battles in 1598, the Swedish forces under Karl eventually forced the king to accept a peace treaty, under which Zygmunt would 
be officially deposed and his son, Władysław IV Vasa, would be sent to Sweden as his successor, provided the boy would be brought up as a 
Protestant. When Zygmunt failed to respond to these demands, the Swedish Parliament elected Karl as the new king. 

As King of Poland, Zygmunt&apos;s primary goals were to create a strong and stable Polish government, as well as combating heresy in all its 
forms. While such policies were unsuccessful in Sweden, he was more successful against the Ottomans. Viewed as a Christian bulwark against 
the Turks, Zygmunt was eager to assist Austria. Promised territorials gains for the kingdom in return for his assistance, Zygmunt sent mer-
cenaries to the Principality of Moldavia to extricate the Ottomans from the area. At the Battle of Chocim (mod. Khotyn) in 1621, the Polish-
Lithuanian Commonwealth held the forces of Sultan Osman II and his Janissaries at bay until late autumn. The Ottomans, sustaining heavy 
losses, were forced to abandon the field. Although indecisive in its outcome, the battle -the largest in the history of the Commonwealth to 
date -was proclaimed a great victory over the &quot;heathens&quot;, and became subsequently an event of great cultural pride (see, for example, Wacław 
Potocki&apos;s, Transakcja wojny chocimskiej [The Progress of the War of Chocim], written between 1669 and 1672). Struck by Jacob Jacobson van 
Emden, with dies engraved by Samuel Ammon, this impressive gold 100 Dukat was struck to commemorate this victory.

The first king of Portugal, Afonso I was the son of Henrique, the Burgundian Count of Portugal, and Teresa, the illegitimate daughter of 
Alfonso VI, King of Léon and Castile. Following Henrique&apos;s death in 1112, Teresa ruled alone, since Afonso was an infant. Teresa&apos;s political 
ambitions allied her with Fernando Pérez de Traba, a powerful Galician noble, who became de facto ruler of Portugal. This arrangement 
angered the Portuguese nobility, who sided with Afonso. Between 1127 and 1128, Afonso successfuly campaigned against his mother and her 
ally, her nephew Alfonso VII, King Léon and Castile. Defeating Fernando Pérez de Traba, Afonso exiled his mother and proclaimed himself 
Prince of Portugal. Afonso then turned his attention to the Almoravids, who controlled the southern Iberian Peninsula -including Lisbon 
and the southern districts of southern Portugal -for about a century. At the Battle of Ourique on 25 July 1139, he overwhelmed Almoravids 
and was proclaimed King of Portugal. The Kingdom of Léon and Castile, however, continued to view Afonso as a rebel, and the Almoravids 
refused to concede their lost territories. Throughout most of his reign, Afonso was involved in wars with his nephew, Alfonso VII, and his 
successor, Fernando II (who captured Afonso at Badajoz). Following the unsuccessful siege of Santarém by the Almohad Caliphate (who 
replaced the Almoravids) in 1184 -in which Fernando II came to the aid of the Portuguese and the Almohad Caliph subsequently perished of 
wounds received -Afonso himself died on 6 December 1185.

($1000) 

Also known as Olof Eiríksson, Olof Skötkonung (the Treasurer) was the first Christian King of Sweden. The epithet Skötkonung refers to 
Olof&apos;s role as a treasure king: taxes, a tributary relationship, the minting of coins, or an ancient land ownership ceremony have all been 
suggested as possible explanations. Much of what is known about him comes from the great Icelandic historian and mythographer, Snorri 
Sturulson, as well as the German medieval chronicler, Adam of Bremen. Olof&apos;s reign was spent in negotiating the complicated politics of 
eleventh century Scandinavia. At one point Olof participated in a Viking raid into northern Germany. There, he captured Edia, the daughter of 
a local West Slavic chieftain. Becoming his mistress, Edia gave birth to King Emund of Sweden (1050-1060) and Astrid Olofsdotter, Queen of 
Norway (d. 1035). Olof appears to have not always been interested in maintaining his territories. He lost control of Denmark (which his father 
had conquered) to Sweyn I Forkbeard and, in 1000, formed and alliance with him. When war erupted between Sweden and Norway following 
Olaf II Haraldsson&apos;s reestablishment of the latter kingdom, it became a personal family feud, since Olaf II Haraldsson had been married to 
Astrid Olofsdotter and later engaged to Ingegerd Olofsdotter. No one on either side wished the war to go on, apart from Olof Skötkonung. 
The Swedes became so incensed at Olof&apos;s obstinacy that one of his revered advisers, Thorgny Lawspeaker, threatened to kill the king if he did 
not cease and turn his attention eastward toward the old areas once controlled by his ancestors. Olof was thereupon compelled to share power 
with his son, Anund, and submit to the terms of the peace treaty forged at Kungahälla in 1020. Olof also betrothed his daughter Ingegerd to 
Yaroslav I the Wise. 

In 1008, Olof Skötkonung was baptised a Christian by St. Sigfrid at Husaby. Olof&apos;s death in the winter of 1021/2 was, according to legend, 
the result of his refusal to sacrifice to the pagan gods. He was later canonized as St. Olof of Sweden.

The Princeps Collection of Transylvania -Part III 

Transylvania (derived from the medieval Latin ultra silvam = &quot;beyond the forest&quot;) is an area located in the Carpathian basin in modern day Romania. Situated near 
the edges of the Mediterranean and Eastern European worlds, the region has long been at the confluence of various cultures. Transylvania was inhabited in ancient 
times by the Dacians, a Thracian people, before being conquered by the Roman emperor Trajan in AD 106, adding a wealthy, silver-rich province to the Empire. 
After the withdrawal of the Romans under Aurelian, the region found itself at the front lines of the Great Migrations, and control of the area passed between Goths, 
Gepids, Vandals, Sarmatians, and Huns, as nomadic tribes flowed southeastward through Europe. 

In the 11th century, Stephen I, the first Christian king of Hungary, led his army into the region to conquer the native Slavic and Romanian peoples, beginning 
the Hungarian settlement pf the region. Over the following centuries, these Hungarians would come to dominate the politics of the region, ruling as vovoides 
(dukes), and maintaining varying degrees of independence, while still swearing fealty to the kings of Hungary. By the mid-12th century, Hungarian kings, seeking 
to protect their eastern border, encouraged German settlement, leading to the addition of a third major ethnic group to the region. Among the various waves of 
German settlers were a number of the famed Teutonic Knights, who constructed a number of fortifications in the area, giving Transylvania its German name of 
Siebenbürgen (&quot;seven forts&quot;). 

From the late 16th century onward, Transylvanian history was characterized by the struggle between the rising power of the Hapsburgs to the west, and the 
encroaching Ottoman Empire to the east. The local rulers struggled to retain their autonomy between these two massive empires, beginning with the rebel Eastern 
Hungarian Kingdom of Szapolyai kings, who contested the Hapsburg accession to the Hungarian throne. These monarchs, as well as their princely successors, 
would generally seek the protection of the Ottoman sultan against the greater threat of the Austrians. Perennial conflicts wracked the region, as Ottoman and 
Austrian armies raged back and forth, punctuated by brutal civil wars between various foreign-supported claimants. The Hapsburgs eventually took the upper hand 
after their victory over the Ottomans at the Battle of Vienna in 1683, leading to the loss of Ottoman protection for Transylvania and the deposition of the native 
rulers in 1691. The territory of Transylvania was fully incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire as a Grand Principality in 1745. 

The complicated history of the region resulted in the production of an interesting and artistically important coinage. The 16th-18th century issues of Transylvania 
are among the most impressive issues struck in Europe at the time. In addition to the usual minors, talers, and ducats, the Transylvanian princes produced a number 
of large gold and silver multiples, both in the usual circular format and in more exotic hexagonal, sun, and moon shapes. During the various conflicts, several 
interesting necessity pieces were also struck. In addition, a number of the talers and multiples were restruck in the 19th century, on behalf of Adolf Resch, author 
of Siebenbürgischen Münzen und Medaillen, the standard reference on the series. 

Classical Numismatic Group is proud to present Part III of the Princeps Collection, featuring gold and silver coinage of Transylvania. Part IV, to be offered in 
Triton XXI session 5 (Electronic Auction 412), will feature minor coinage of the region.

($15,000) 

From the Dr. Andrew Wayne Collection. Found Wye, Kent, 2010. 

According to Naismith, the obverse is of the Inscribed/Open Cross type (circa 854-64), while the moneyer, general design of the reverse type, 
and epigraphic style are all indicative of the Floreate Cross type (circa 864-865/6). The absence of the type in the Dorking hoard suggests it 
was struck near the end of the Inscribed/Open Cross coinage, and, along with the unique Naismith type C218.1 penny of Archbishop Ceolnoth, 
suggests that there was a period of experimentation during this time.

Commissioned by the Commonwealth to improve upon English coinage, Pierre Blondeau arrived from France in 1649 and, with the help 
of engraver Thomas Simon, immediately began to produce patterns which would focus upon his primary concern: the marking of the edges 
of coins with either lettering or reeding-an important deterrent to the practice of clipping. This series of patterns was struck for 1651, and 
presents the first encounter of a lettered edge within English coinage. Opposition to Blondeau increased at the mint, however, and he returned 
to France in 1656. The Frenchman would ultimately be called back to England in 1662 to oversee the modernization of English coinage and 
the full implementation of edge marking in 1663.

Presented to sailors and officers below the rank of captain, this medal commemorates the successful naval endeavors against the Dutch 
in 1665. The intensifying quarrels between rival merchants in England and Holland culminated with a decisive English victory under the 
command of the Duke of York, Prince Rupert, and the Earl of Sandwich near Lowestoft.

Signed at the Dutch city of Breda on 31 July 1667, the Treaty of Breda brought the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667) to a hasty end due 
to the invasion of the Southern Netherlands by Louis XIV. Prompted by Michiel de Ruyter&apos;s successful &apos;Raid on the Medway&apos; a little more 
than a month earlier, which gave the Dutch control of the seas around the southern coast of England, the English quickly sued for peace. Under 
the terms of the treaty, the Dutch East India Company secured its control of the East Indies and the lucrative worldwide trade in nutmeg. They 
also gained concessions to the English Navigation Acts, which now allowed them to import German goods into England. In the long term, 
however, the treaty provided England with the opportunity to expand its overseas empire in North America. The unwillingness of the Dutch 
to recover Nieuw Nederland, taken by the English in 1664 (its restoration had been an English concession to peace), now gave England full 
control of several new colonies (New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania), as well as the city of Nieuw Amsterdam -now renamed 
New York City. The restoration of Acadia by the English to the French foreshadowed the series of wars that would be fought between the two 
powers for dominance in the North American theater, culminating in the French and Indian War (1754-1763).

From the Jonathan P. Rosen Collection. 

Recent evidence has illuminated the full meaning of this reverse design, as well as its creator, through the discovery of a 50-page manuscript 
overlooked for many years. Then Master of the Mint Isaac Newton was aware of the real threat posed to England at the outset of the eighteenth 
century in the form of Anne&apos;s half brother James (James &apos;III,&apos; the Old Pretender) and King Louis XIV of France. Rather than simply being a 
two-headed monstrous figure, the fantastic creature, which was the object of Anne&apos;s wrath, was specifically designed to be the menace forged 
through this Stuart-France Catholic alliance. Maybe even more surprising than the hidden iconography, however, is the fact that Newton 
himself proposed the symbolism. Already accomplished in the fields of science and math, his role at the mint allowed him to utilize his talents 
for the betterment of England&apos;s coinage, while also giving him a political voice heretofore unknown.

The 1887 East Harptree Hoard 

CNG is pleased to present a selection of coins from the Harptree Hoard of 1887. This hoard was discovered in the village of East Harptree, 
located approximately 16 miles southwest of Bath. The hoard consisted of 1496 silver coins, five silver ingots, and a Roman silver ring set 
with a carnelian intaglio stone. The coins are 4th century, covering the period of Constantine the Great to Gratian (circa AD 306 to 383). 
The landowner, Mr. William Kettlewell, made the hoard available to the British Museum, and it was first written up by John Evans in The 
Numismatic Chronicle of 1888 (pp. 22-46). The British Museum kept 25 of the most interesting coins from the hoard, and the rest of hoard 
was returned to the owner. 

A portion of the hoard, along with the original jug that contained them, was given to a local church for display by William Kettlewell&apos;s son, 
Colonel Kettlewell. These were eventually stolen. Many years later, the balance of the hoard, nearly 1200 pieces, was given to the father of 
the individual who subsequently consigned the hoard to Spink, where they were sold last year. Spink wrote-up the hoard for their INSIDER 
Magazine (Summer 2016 issue). Overall, the quality of the Harptree Hoard is exceptional. The coins exhibit beautiful surfaces with lovely 
cabinet toning, with very little clipping -remarkable condition for coins of this period. 

A rare opportunity to own a coin from a documented hoard found 130 years ago.
